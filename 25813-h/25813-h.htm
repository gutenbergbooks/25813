<h2><span class="smcap">Robert Trask Arrives in Manila From Amoy</span></h2>


<p>As the tubby little China Coast steamer
marched up Manila Bay, Trask stood under
the bridge on the skimpy "promenade deck"
and waited impatiently for the doctor's boat to come
alongside. He was the only white passenger among a
motley lot of Chinese merchants and half-castes of
varied hues, and he was glad the passage was at an
end.</p>

<p>He had made the trip with a Finnish skipper, disconcertingly
cross-eyed, a Lascar mate who looked
like a pirate and had a voice like a school-girl, a purser
addicted to the piccolo late at night, and fellow-passengers
who jabbered interminably about nothing at all in
half a dozen languages. So Trask regarded the spires
and red roofs of Manila with the hungry eyes of a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
who has been separated from civilization and his own
kind too many days to remember.</p>

<p>Before the steamer anchored, Trask saw the <i>Taming</i>
passing out for Hong Kong, white moustaches of foam
at her forefoot and her decks alive with men and
women. She was as smart as a big liner.</p>

<p>But he looked away from her to the Luneta and the
villa-like Bay View Hotel, white and stately, at the
lip of the bay. That was his goal, for he had promised
Marjorie Locke he would be in Manila the day before,
and he was now a day late.</p>

<p>The customs boarding officer took him ashore with
his bags and graciously allowed him to depart in a
<i>quilez</i>, after holding his baggage for examination.
Trask went whirling up Calle San Fernando, through
Plaza Oriente, Calle Rosario, Plaza Moraga, over the
Bridge of Spain and into shady Bazumbayan Drive,
skirting the moat of the Walled City. It was a
roundabout way but the quickest, for the <i>cochero</i> made
his ponies travel at a good clip for a double fare.</p>

<p>The rig shot across the baking Luneta, and ere it
had come to a full stop before the Bay View Trask was
out and into the darkened hall of the tourist headquarters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of the Philippine capital.</p>

<p>The place appeared deserted except for a sleepy
<i>muchacho</i>, who staggered out from some palms, looking
for the new guest's baggage.</p>

<p>"Have you got an outside room?" demanded Trask
of the drowsing English clerk behind the railing, as he
pulled the register toward him and scanned the open
page.</p>

<p>"I say! Mr. Trask!"</p>

<p>The young man looked up. "Correct," he said.
"Where did we&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I'm Wilkins, sir, G. O. H., Colombo. You were
there last year, sir, in from Singapore. You had an
argument with a 'rickshaw man. I was managing the
bar at the time."</p>

<p>"Sure enough, Wilkins! How d'ye do!" and
Trask extended a hand which Wilkins shook with
fervour, striking a bell with the other for the Chinese
bar-boy.</p>

<p>"Two stone gingers with a finger of Scotch," said
Wilkins. "Fine room on the bay-side, Mr. Trask.
And you'll find it quiet enough."</p>

<p>"It does look quiet for you," said Trask, as he wrote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
his name in the register and took off his helmet. It
was plain that the tropics had put their mark upon
him, for in contrast to the deep tan of burnt umber
over cheeks and chin, the upper part of his forehead
showed a white band of skin, the helmet line of the
veteran traveller in low latitudes. His black eyes were
embedded in nests of tiny wrinkles, the "tropical
squint," which no mere <i>griffin</i> ever has as a passport.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Wilkins. "The China boat cleaned
the place up this morning. Not a tripper left."</p>

<p>"No?" cried Trask, with sudden concern. He
turned to the register again and flopped back the
pages. "You must have a man here named Locke, an
American, travelling with his daughter."</p>

<p>"Gone," said Wilkins. "Left on the <i>Taming</i> to
catch the Pacific Mail at Hong Kong."</p>

<p>"If that isn't my blooming luck!" moaned Trask,
shutting the register with a slam and turning his back
to the desk, a picture of limp despair.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," continued Wilkins, coming out from behind
his barrier, "the Lockes left here Friday for
Dagupan, to be back in time to sail this noon. They
must have caught the <i>Taming</i>. I sent their spare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
trunks down this morning to be held for Mr. Locke.
He wasn't to come back here, but go right aboard from
the morning train. Friends of yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We were shipmates from Honolulu coming
out, three months back."</p>

<p>"Very respectable people," said Wilkins. "I understand
Mr. Locke's quite wealthy."</p>

<p>"I imagine so," replied Trask, despondently. It
was hard luck, for he had managed to take a month's
vacation for no other purpose than to meet Marjorie
Locke for a few days in Manila and here he was, like a
man marooned, with nothing to do, and the Lockes out
in the China Sea, bound for the "States."</p>

<p>"But why shouldn't they go?" thought Trask. The
fact that he was secretly in love with Marjorie Locke,
and had allowed himself to believe that she rather
liked him, was no reason why she should wait in
Manila merely because he had told her that he expected
to be in that city on a certain date.</p>

<p>"Oh, that reminds me!" said Wilkins suddenly, as
he ran in behind the railing again. "Look here! I've
a letter for you. Been here a couple of days, never
struck me at the time it was you, never dawned on me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
until I saw you at the desk, then I remembered your
name."</p>

<p>"Mail for me?" asked Trask. "Why, nobody
knows I'm in Manila. I'm supposed to be up in
Korea."</p>

<p>"Not mail, precisely, sir. It was left here a few
days ago."</p>

<p>"Who left it?" Trask was suddenly hopeful.</p>

<p>"Can't say, sir. I found it on the desk. Rather
mysterious, you know. I'd say it was&mdash;&mdash;" He
paused, to rifle the letter-rack.</p>

<p>"Was what?"</p>

<p>"If you don't mind, sir, I'd say it was queer, rather
extraordinary circumstance. Now where could I have
put it?"</p>

<p>"How was it queer? Don't keep me on the grid.
What about it?"</p>

<p>"The fact is," said Wilkins, "I'd consider it a bit
irregular. The backing was done with a typewriter,
but the paper&mdash;I'd say the envelope was business, but
not house stationary. It struck me that way, if you
don't mind my saying it. Quite involuntary on my
part, but natural, sir, considering the name looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
familiar. Of course, I never remembered you in
connection with Colombo until I'd seen your face&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly," said Trask, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Stupid of me not to think of it before," went on
Wilkins, musingly. "We hotel men get to notice
things, and I shouldn't like to be so slow as a usual
thing with&mdash;&mdash; Ah, here it is! Got in among the
steamer guides."</p>

<p>Trask reached across for the letter. It was a large,
square envelope of a bulky woven paper. On it was
typed in purple:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Mr. Robert Trask. Consolidated Mines Syndicate.<br />
To be called for.</i><br />
</p>

<p>The letters of the words were topped by a faint and
blurry purple line, showing that the heavy envelope
had undergone troubles by being rolled into a typewriter.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Trask. He tore it open just as
the bar-boy appeared with a tray decorated with stone
ginger jars and glasses. The letter read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Trask:</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Thank you so much for the flowers you sent me at the
King Edward in Hong Kong. They were lovely. So
sorry we shan't see you again. I remember you said you'd
be in Manila the tenth of this month. Dad has changed
his plans and wants to get back home, so we leave Manila
by the <i>Taming</i> on the eleventh. We are going up to
Dagupan by train and will reach Manila to sail by noon.
So, if you do get to Manila on the tenth, I think it would be
jolly to see you on board. We'll go directly from the
station to the tender. I'll address this on the machine,
so it'll look most businesslike, for Mr. Wilkins, the clerk, is
prone to gossip. Thank you again for your kindness in
Hong Kong and your many kindnesses to Dad and me on
board the <i>Manchuria</i>.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
<span style="padding-right: 5em;">Sincerely,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Marjorie Locke.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>Trask, smiling broadly, put the letter into his
pocket.</p>

<p>"That must be good news, sir. Hope it is. Shall
we go out on the big veranda for our nip? Cooler out
there."</p>

<p>"What? Yes, certainly," said Trask, reminded of
where he was as he looked up to see the bar-boy
standing beside him and Wilkins waiting. In spite of
the fact that the letter was ample proof that Miss
Locke was gone, it had put his head in a whirl. At<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
least she hadn't forgotten. He followed Wilkins.</p>

<p>"You look quite bucked up now," said Wilkins, as
he pulled out a chair beside a marble-topped table.</p>

<p>"I do feel better," admitted Trask. "Just the
same, I'm bitterly disappointed. No doubt I'm ungrateful,
but I've played in rotten luck."</p>

<p>"You expected to meet the Lockes?" suggested
Wilkins. "Too bad."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Trask, and taking a glass from the bar-boy,
sat down.</p>

<p>"Here's luck and a long stay, sir," said Wilkins.</p>

<p>"Thanks." But Trask was rather listless and tired,
frankly bored by the clerk. He stared out over the
sickle curve of the bay along the Cavite shore, where a
line of white beach made a barrier between the water
and the green jungle. The red-roofed buildings of
Cavite lay out on the end of the sickle like a clutter of
bleached bones cast up by the tide.</p>

<p>The bay lay like a great shining shield before him,
blazing with millions of mirrors that danced on the
shoulders of the sleek and lazy swells, lifting in the sun-dazzle
from the entrance, some twenty-five miles away.</p>

<p>Trask looked at his watch. It was well after one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the hour when men take shelter from the sun in caf&eacute;s
to talk over prolonged tiffins and wait for the heat of
mid-day to wane.</p>

<p>A hush had fallen over the city, like the lull which
precedes the breaking of a typhoon, a panting sort of
hush. Heat waves rose from the bare expanse of
the Luneta like siroccos from the nether regions, and
the palm trees of the Malecon Drive, seen through
the shimmering air, appeared to dance like souls in
torture.</p>

<p>Beyond the Luneta the tawny walls of the city
fairly cracked with the heat, and over them could be
seen the sea of roofs of the intra-mural section, the
heart of Manila, inside its ancient bastions. Spires
rose from the ruck of low buildings like dead trees
denuded of their branches. Down the bay a streamer
of smoke hung over the Bataan hills, the last vestige of
the outward-bound <i>Taming</i>, a sort of farewell pennant
left behind to tell that she was driving jauntily toward
Hong Kong.</p>

<p>"It'll be cooler in an hour," ventured Wilkins.</p>

<p>"If you'll order a rig for me," said Trask, "I'll roll
down to the customs house and see about my baggage."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"How about tiffin, sir?"</p>

<p>"Good idea. I'll have it with you. Never mind
the rig now. By the way, I heard some gossip coming
down. Did you ever hear of a man named Dinshaw?
A sailor?"</p>

<p>"Looney Dinshaw? Raw-ther! He's a joke."</p>

<p>"How a joke?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the poor old blighter, he sells pictures which
he paints himself. They're pictures of an island he
says he was wrecked on, that's full of gold. Comes
up here and sells 'em to trippers."</p>

<p>"But the island?" persisted Trask. "There was a
Swede yarning with the skipper, but they wouldn't let
me hear."</p>

<p>"Dinshaw's <i>loco</i>," said Wilkins. "Lost his ship on
this island three or four years ago. It's somewhere up
the north coast. He was taken off by a Jap fisher
crew blown down from the Rykukus. He lost his ship
right enough, and his mind with it. To hear him talk
you'd think it was solid gold."</p>

<p>"Solid gold is what I'm hunting for when I'm working,"
said Trask with a smile. "I'd like to look into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
this business."</p>

<p>"There's plenty who's looked into it, sir, but they
can't get anything but babble out of the old fellow.
He thinks everybody wants to cheat him."</p>

<p>"Where can I find him?"</p>

<p>"In the Sailors' Home, kept by Prayerful Jones in
Calle San Fernando, a charity place for sailors on the
beach. I say, you're not serious?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I am. Not that I expect to find a solid
gold island, but if it's off the coast of Luzon it might
give me a lead to something up in the mountains. The
Igorrotes find some gold up in the rivers and I've
heard the rocks were mighty heavy. May be iron
pyrites, or it may be the real thing."</p>

<p>"I can have him up here," suggested Wilkins.
"Just drop a word over the 'phone to Prayerful Jones.
Nobody need know what it's about. I'll hint he may
sell a picture."</p>

<p>"Shoot!" said Trask. "I've got a month to kill,
and some money to gamble on my own hook. I may
take a flyer on it, if I can get anything definite out of
this Dinshaw."</p>

<p>"You'll have half the waterfront on your heels if you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
let it out that you're taking Dinshaw to his island.
Plenty would go if he'd tell 'em where it is, but they
want to skin him."</p>

<p>"Then we'll keep it mum! Hello! Who's coming?"</p>

<p>He heard the rattle of hoofs and looked across the
Luneta to see a victoria whirl out of Bagumbayan
Drive. It was occupied by a man in a pongee suit and
a young woman in white with a blue parasol which
rose above the rig like a porcelain minaret.</p>

<p>"The Lockes!" cried Wilkins.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Trask. "Don't say a word about
me. I'll surprise 'em!" He picked up a copy of the
<i>Cablenews</i> from the table and hid himself behind its
ample pages.</p>

<p>"We'll stick right here until the next boat," he
heard Locke saying as the victoria stopped. "I'd
like to see somebody pry me loose from this porch."</p>

<p>Trask looked over the top of his paper to see
Marjorie Locke, in duck skirt and linen coat, climb
down from the victoria. Her hair was as yellow as her
wide-brimmed "sailor" and her eyes as blue as her
parasol. She was laughing gaily as she mounted the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
stoop.</p>

<p>"You missed the boat!" exclaimed Wilkins, as he
came out.</p>

<p>"Missed it forty miles!" said Locke, taking off his
floppy Bangkok hat and using a handkerchief on his
face as though it were a blotter. His nose was peeled
from sunburn, but his round and rubicund face fairly
oozed good humour.</p>

<p>"Your luggage&mdash;I sent it, sir," said Wilkins.</p>

<p>"Hang the luggage! I'll have a soda bath right
away. I've got the prickly heat so bad I feel like a
human pincushion!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Wilkins.</p>

<p>"Be game, Dad! You always told me you liked the
tropics."</p>

<p>"So I do&mdash;at home in the winter time. I believe
you knew we'd miss that boat, Marge. I'm wise!
You want to see where Magellan landed and where
Legaspi gasped."</p>

<p>"I can't say you're a born tourist," said his daughter.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. Just now I'd start for the North Pole.
Wow! Those Spanish fellows sure liked a hot climate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
when they went out to take up land! Whoof! I'd
give a lot for ten cubic feet of 'Frisco fog right now!
Turn the blowers on in our rooms, Wilkins, and say,
aim mine at the bath water. Well, look who's here!
If that isn't Trask I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Trask!" cried Miss Locke. "How jolly!
Fancy meeting you!"</p>

<p>"Fancy meeting him!" exclaimed Locke, derisively.
"It's a frameup, that's what it is, a frameup on me and
my prickly heat!"</p>

<p>Trask climbed out from behind his paper and stood
up, bowing and grinning.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you missed your boat&mdash;almost," he
said.</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks!" said Locke, taking his hand and pulling
him forward. "I don't give a whoop. Marge,
I'll bet forty dollars you knew that Dagupan train
wouldn't catch the <i>Taming</i>!"</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd, Dad. We're so glad to meet you
again, Mr. Trask. We were stupid about the train,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll have to excuse me," said her father, "I hear
the bath going. Wilkins! Feed us tiffin till we're<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
blue in the face," and he disappeared into the <i>sala</i>.</p>

<p>"And there isn't a boat to connect with the Pacific
Mail for twenty-six days," said Trask. "I'm on a
vacation."</p>

<p>"You know so much about Manila, too," she said.
"But we may go on the Thursday boat."</p>

<p>"The Thursday boat?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"If there's a Thursday boat, I'll wreck it," said
Trask, and clapped his hands for the <i>muchacho</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Dinshaw Tells of His Island</span></h2>


<p>"Here," said Locke, "comes Rip Van Winkle&mdash;without
his dog."</p>

<p>"A beggar!" whispered Marjorie, looking
past Trask. "Poor old man!"</p>

<p>Trask turned from the table, and saw at the end of
the veranda an old man approaching with a package
under his arm. He looked like a vagabond, in khaki
trousers with the bottoms fringed by tatters through
which showed his bare ankles; pitiful old cloth shoes;
a patched coat of white drill with frogging across the
front such as Chinese mess boys wear; and a battered,
rimless straw hat. He drew near the table with weary
feet, hesitatingly and dazed, as though he had lost his
way, peering about like an owl thrust into the light of
mid-day from a darkened belfry.</p>

<p>"Why, it must be Captain Dinshaw!" said Trask.</p>

<p>The old man stopped ten feet from the trio and lifting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
his head like a hound who has taken scent, gazed at
them suspiciously. Then he smiled toothlessly and
swung off his bowl of a hat with a grand air.</p>

<p>"Aye, sir," he said, in a weak but shrill voice.
"Cap'n Dinshaw, late of the bark, <i>James B. Wetherall</i>,
lost in a typhoon an' Lord ha' mercy on us!"</p>

<p>"This is a shame!" said Locke, in a cautious whisper
to Trask, as he leaned back in his grass chair to
light a cigar. "I hate to see a white man like that in
this country."</p>

<p>"He looks hungry," said Marjorie. "Dad, call the
boy!"</p>

<p>"It's an interesting case," said Trask. "I want you
to hear him. Wilkins had him up so I could talk to
him. He's got an island."</p>

<p>"Would the lady buy a picter?" inquired Dinshaw,
with a little bow. "Hand painted by myself,
out of my head, from my own recollections. A
good suvverner." He began to unwrap his flat
parcel.</p>

<p>"Come over here and sit down," said Locke, rising,
and pushing forward a chair. "You ought to have
something to drink and a bite to eat. Shouldn't be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
out in sun like this with that sort of headgear."</p>

<p>Dinshaw muttered a thanks, and dropped into the
chair, his thin, wrinkled face drawing into a queer
smile. He let the package fall across his knees, and
his hat dropped from his trembling fingers. He
stroked a tuft of whisker under his chin.</p>

<p>"I don't mind the heat, but the soup's bad," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Here's the boy," said Trask. "Now what's it to
be?"</p>

<p>"Eh! Oh, Ah Wing! That boy knows me. A tot
of gin with a stinger, and thank you kindly. A
master should go with his ship," and he touched his
sparse white hair which showed his scalp, and nodded
his head, staring out over the bay as if in a reverie.
The colour was bleached out of his failing eyes and
they had a habit of roving about unsteadily, a quality
common in old sailors and probably acquired in a
lifetime of watching heaving seas.</p>

<p>"Bring some more of the fish, and a big cup of
coffee," said Trask, as Ah Wing grinned and turned to
go.</p>

<p>"So you sell pictures," encouraged Marjorie. "And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
paint them yourself!"</p>

<p>"Aye, ma'am. All hands lost but myself&mdash;piled up
on a reef of this island. A master should go with his
ship." He clutched at his parcel and began tearing
off the string.</p>

<p>"Picters o' my island. I allus was a painter," he
continued, "if I did foller the sea. Why, in my bark,
the <i>Wetherall</i> it was, I had fancy picters on the bulkheads
an' gold linin' over the white but she got in a
twistin' jimmycane, such as we have in these waters.
Thar's my island!"</p>

<p>He held up one canvas, a foot high and two feet
wide, tacked over a piece of board. It was a gaudy
representation of an island wrought with pathetic
lack of skill. There was a conical peak at the left end
smeared with a slash of purple, and over it a very red
and very round sun. The land sloped away from the
peak to the other end of the island, and was lost in a
white streak extending seaward, the the bony finger of
a skeleton, marking a reef clothed with fuzzy breakers.
A rocky ledge ran down to where the reef began and a
big gray stone stood up abruptly, giving the island the
appearance of a bluff-bowed vessel, and under it, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
triangular patch of beach. Near the rock were four
palm trees. One bent over at a sharp angle, as if it
had been partly uprooted, and its moppy fronds almost
trailed in the still water of a pool formed by a
second reef, not so clearly defined, which ran parallel
with the land. Except inside this natural basin the
whole shore of the island was wreathed by white
rollers and behind the shore line was a fringe of vividly
green jungle.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't that splendid!" exclaimed Marjorie.</p>

<p>"It's a work o' art, that's what everybody says,"
remarked the old man with a show of pride.</p>

<p>"What do you call the island?" asked Locke.</p>

<p>"The name don't matter, sir. 'Dinshaw's Island'
they call it hereabouts, in honour o' the fact I was
wrecked on it. Blown off my course in a typhoon at
night and went smash into this reef ye see here. I
was washed out o' the riggin', an' when I come to I
was on the beach here, wreckage all round, an' the sun
shinin' bright as a whiffet, an' me all beat out an'
water-logged. Right there it was," and he put his
thumb on a spot near the rock.</p>

<p>"Is it a big island?" asked Trask.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not in the way ye might think. Big enough as it
goes, but it ain't the size what counts," and he broke
into a cackling laugh, wagging his head, as if he held
the secret of a great joke.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" asked Locke.</p>

<p>"Thar's lots as would like to know, sir," said Dinshaw,
gravely. "But I ain't in the way o' tellin', not
until I can see my way clear to go myself."</p>

<p>"It is near the mainland of Luzon?" asked Trask.</p>

<p>Dinshaw turned quickly and peered at him suspiciously,
pursing his lips.</p>

<p>"It is," he said, finally.</p>

<p>"I don't see any other land in the picture," ventured
Trask, scanning the canvas with more care.</p>

<p>"Ye bet ye don't!" snapped Dinshaw, with sudden
asperity. "I left that out so they can't find it. Lots
as would like to find Dinshaw's island, young man, but
I'm savin' it for myself. Jarrow said he'd take me,
but he never did. He wants to go steal it himself. I
know. I know. They can't fool me, if I am old."</p>

<p>"Steal your island?" asked Marjorie. "Why, how
could anybody steal an island?"</p>

<p>"What's on it?" whispered Dinshaw.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, ho," said Locke. "Then there's something
on it, is there? Now we're interesting! Treasure, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Gold on it," piped Dinshaw, with childish simplicity.
"Gold enough to make us all rich. Gold
enough to ballast a hundred ships!"</p>

<p>"Ye see that reef? Well, I lay in that bight thar,
an' the sun come out. The eye o' the storm it was, and
after awhile it come on to blow again, as is the custom
with twisters. When the weather cleared again, I
don't know how long it was, I crawled down and overhauled
the flotsam. There was part of Number One
boat, with a beaker o' water an' a ham from the cabin
stores. Later, I found my mate, Seth Colburn. He
was dead. He'd sailed with me all his life, come from
down Eastport way, and a smart man he was, too, at
figgers. I dug his grave with my bare hands in this
patch o' sand, right there under the ridge, and it was
all yaller, shinin' in the sun, as it run through my
fingers. All glittery an' soft, like corn meal. That
island's full o' it, I'm tellin' ye! It'll make us all
rich!" His voice rose, and quavered with excitement.</p>

<p>Locke looked at Trask questioningly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here," said Trask, passing Dinshaw the glass
which the bar-boy brought. "Drink this."</p>

<p>"Jarrow said he'd take me," gasped Dinshaw after
he had drunk.</p>

<p>"Who's Jarrow?" asked Trask.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's got a schooner," said Dinshaw.</p>

<p>"So your island is full of gold," said Locke, with a
skeptical wink for the benefit of Trask and Marjorie.
"And you sell pictures of it, eh?"</p>

<p>"Aye, gold. An' Seth Colburn's buried in it. He'd
laugh if he knew. But Jarrow'll take me some day,
an' when he does, I'll go back to Yarmouth an' build a
big house, all snug an' shipshape, with a piazza like the
quarter-deck of a frigate, an' a garden with petunias,
an'&mdash;an'&mdash;have good soup for supper. I fed my crew
better'n Prayerful Jones does, an' I tell him so every
day. Them that sailed with Cap'n Dinshaw had duff
twice a week with raisins in it, sir, an' Wes' Injia
m'lasses."</p>

<p>Marjorie passed Dinshaw a plate of sandwiches and
served him with a cup of coffee. Trask drew aside,
and Locke followed him.</p>

<p>"This is right in your line," said Locke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've a mind to investigate it," said Trask. "Heard
some talk about it on my way down from Amoy."</p>

<p>"Sounds fishy to me," said Locke. "I believe he's
off his head."</p>

<p>"That's what they say here. Wilkins was telling
me about him."</p>

<p>"You think there's gold there?"</p>

<p>"Possibly. The formation of the ledge looks promising.
He may have run into a deposit washed out by
the sea, merely a pocket, but significant. You see, if
the ledge in the picture is a continuation of a crest from
the mainland, I might follow up the lead on Luzon.
There is gold out here but the country hasn't been
properly prospected, owing to the troubles with the
natives. I'd like to look things over on my own hook.
Of course the company would go in on it with me.
I've always wanted to come here but my chief never
thought much of it. So I'm on a vacation, and what
I find for myself I'll be able to swing. If Dinshaw
would split&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'd get yourself into a tangle with him," said
Locke. "He'd most likely go around telling folks you
wanted to steal his island if you talked with him about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
it."</p>

<p>"I'll go slowly and I may get his confidence after
awhile."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you luck," said Locke. "I'm going to
make the Thursday boat."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of going on this trip for a couple
of weeks," Trask hastened to say.</p>

<p>"Hong Kong for mine," said Locke.</p>

<p>"Dad! Come here, please," called Marjorie. "Captain
Dinshaw wants to go to his island. It seems to
me that you men who are looking for something to do
might help him out."</p>

<p>"I'll give him ten <i>pesos</i> for one of those pictures,"
said Locke.</p>

<p>"The other for me at the same price," said Trask.</p>

<p>"Stingies!" cried Marjorie. "If I were a man, I'd
go find his island."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will," said Trask.</p>

<p>"None of this Count of Monte Cristo stuff for me,"
said Locke, as he laid down a bill before Dinshaw.
"Say, captain, I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll pay your
passage home first class if you'll go so that you can get
back to your relatives. Now you can't say I'm a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
piker, Marge."</p>

<p>"Ten <i>pesos</i>!" whispered Dinshaw, staring at the
bill. "Thank ye kindly, sir. I'll make ye all
rich."</p>

<p>"But how about going home?" said Locke. "I'll
fix you up with some clothes. This is no place for an
old man like you."</p>

<p>"Home!" said Dinshaw. "I'm at the Sailors'
Home."</p>

<p>"But you ought to be back in the States."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' back to my island, that's what," insisted
Dinshaw. "Jarrow said he'd take me."</p>

<p>"Dad, you said I could go anywhere I wanted on this
trip," pouted Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Where do you want to go, Miss Trinkets?"</p>

<p>"I think it would be gorgeous fun to find this island.
I've never done anything romantic in my life, and I've
always wanted to elope, or something. I'll run away
with a drummer in a band&mdash;or something like that, if
I have to go home without finding an island&mdash;a
tropical island, with a wreck, too&mdash;and sailors buried
on it&mdash;and gold! I'm for it, strong."</p>

<p>"Not so strong as I am for a touch of cool weather,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
laughed Locke. "That reminds me, it's time for
another soda&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dad!"</p>

<p>But Locke disappeared into the hall, laughing, saying
something about Timbuctoo and other places he
would not care to visit.</p>

<p>"And he's finding fault about having to live in
tourist hotels and listen to bored guides! And here's
a chance to get off the main stamping ground, as he
calls it, and help a poor old man."</p>

<p><!--**changed single quote to double-->"We don't like to get far from the comforts of
civilization, after all," said Trask. "But I don't
know of anything I'd rather do than take you and your
father cruising."</p>

<p>"I wish there wasn't any old Thursday boat,"
wailed Marjorie. "We might argue him into going
if we had more time."</p>

<p>"You've got to miss that Thursday boat," declared
Trask. "We ought to be able to kidnap him or
something."</p>

<p>"What's the name?" asked Dinshaw, rising from
the table and putting on his hat.</p>

<p>"Locke," said Marjorie. "Mr. Locke. You come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
up again to-morrow and see us."</p>

<p>"I'll have to paint another picter," said Dinshaw.</p>

<p>"Here," said Trask. "You take this one with you,
and bring it back to-morrow, when I'll pay you twenty
<i>pesos</i> for it. That'll give you an excuse for coming
back. And don't say a word to anybody."</p>

<p>"Locke," murmured Dinshaw. "Mr. Locke."</p>

<p>"You ought to eat some more," said Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Can't stop," said Dinshaw, gathering up the other
picture, which he had not unwrapped. "Can't wait
for the tide. I'll go see Jarrow. He said he'd take me."</p>

<p>"Now look here," said Trask. "Don't you say a
word to anybody. Understand? Don't tell anybody!"</p>

<p>"I'm a clam, sir, a clam," said Dinshaw, solemnly,
and blinking his eyes at the sun which assailed him
from the bare Luneta, he hurried down the steps and
hastened away.</p>

<p>"Poor old duffer," said Trask.</p>

<p>"We've got to help him find his island," said Marjorie.
"I'll tell you what to do. Dad wants to get
up to Hong Kong because there's a man at the King
Edward he can beat at billiards."</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with it?" asked Trask,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
vaguely.</p>

<p>"You're a regular man!" she retorted. "Can't you
see? Can you play billiards?"</p>

<p>"A little," admitted Trask.</p>

<p>"Come up to our rooms and have tea," she said.
"Then you get Dad into a game of billiards, play as
well as you can and&mdash;lose."</p>

<p>"A whale of an idea!" exclaimed Trask.</p>

<p>"And don't say anything more about the island,"
warned Marjorie. "Dad's stubborn, but he's easy to
handle. We'll act as if we didn't care a whoop about
this Dinshaw business&mdash;until we miss the Thursday
boat. Then we'll give him no rest. But remember,
I'm for the Thursday boat. That's just to throw him
off his guard. He's a dear old Dad, but sometimes
he's balky."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Captain Dinshaw Pulls a Long Bow</span></h2>


<p>Below the customs house in Manila, close to
the embankment of the Pasig River, on the
Binondo side, opposite Fort Santiago and the
Walled City, there is an ancient adobe building
thatched with <i>nipa</i>. Its narrow door opens on the
waterfront. High and narrow windows, devoid of
glass or shell, are mere slits cut through the walls.
Seen from the river, they have a striking resemblance
to the gun-ports of an ancient battleship.</p>

<p>This place is known to sailormen the world over as
"The Cuartel" and probably takes its name from the
fact that it was a sort of block house used by the
Spanish, to hold the approaches to the river. It
stands at the head of a narrow little street which twists
back into the native quarter of Tondo, and affords a
haven for the mixed population which labours on the
Mole&mdash;coolies, seamen, Chinese mess "boys," Tagalog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
<i>cargadores</i>, Lascar <i>serangs</i>, stalwart Sikh watchmen
from the hemp and sugar <i>godowns</i>, squat Germans in
white suits with pencils stuck in their sun helmets and
wearing amber-coloured spectacles. British clerks
with cargo lists, customs brokers, barking mates with
blasphemous vocabularies, Scotch mechanics with
parched throats, and all the underlings who have to do
with ships and their freights.</p>

<p>Here they all gather for their tipple and gossip, easy
at friendships and quick at quarrels. They babble of
things which their employers would have kept secret,
their tongues limbered by drams from square-shouldered
greenish bottles, Dutch as dykes, which line the
shelves behind the bar.</p>

<p>The Cuartel is owned by a black man from Batavia
who calls himself Vanderzee. His mother was a
Kling. He was berth-deck cook of a gunboat, by his
own report, and "Jack o' the Dust" in a river monitor
up "China way." That's all anybody seems to know
about him, and it is suspected that he has his own
reasons for keeping a clove hitch on his tongue about
himself.</p>

<p>There are legends about fortunes which have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
made out of bits of news gleaned from conversations
before the bar of the Cuartel. The lampman of a
Blackpool tramp remarked over his peg of rum that
his skipper liked smoked eels for breakfast and was
taking on a cargo of best steaming coal for Kamrangh
Bay. This knowledge enabled Togo to destroy the
Baltic fleet in the Tushima Straits. And a stevedore
made something like a million dollars out of a cargo of
canned salmon by hearing some cockney give his
theory about how the blockade could be run to Port
Arthur.</p>

<p>Vanderzee made some of his profits out of a little
room at the far end of his bar, where a man could sit
hidden by tawny <i>tapa</i> curtains rove on a bamboo pole,
and have privacy while he heard what was being said
at the bar. The room had a marble-topped table and
two chairs.</p>

<p>Two men were inside of an afternoon, playing at
cribbage. One was short and heavily built, with
powerful shoulders threatening to break through the
seams of his white drill jacket. His black hair was
clipped close to his skull, making his ears appear to
stick out amazingly. He had black moustaches which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
grew down over his mouth, masking it. His face was
brown and rough hewn. A straw hat, curled up into
a grotesque shape, lay at his feet like some distorted
bivalve. Its owner had an air of authority about
him, even a touch of dominance in the way he scanned
his cards or moved the pegs in the board. When his
arm went out to the table, it moved with a ponderous
steadiness. His brown and hairy hand had the slow,
powerful sweep of a derrick-boom.</p>

<p>His companion was thin and angular, quick-eyed
and nervous in his movements, as though he moved on
a gear of higher speed than his opponent in the game.
He crouched over the table when he shuffled the cards
or played them, without lifting his elbows from the
table, in the fashion of a jealous dog with a bone. He
wore a blue cap with a polished black visor, tilted back
on his head, giving him a rakish, devil-may-care aspect.
His long and lean face, cut with wrinkles, was twisted
into a sly grin, as if he thought he had the advantage
of the other man.</p>

<p>The <i>tapa</i> curtains were closed. The alcove was
lighted from two of the narrow windows, cut so high
in the wall that they gave no view of the Mole and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
street outside unless a man were to climb on a chair and
get his shoulders on a level with the bamboo rafters,
where the tiny lizards prowled in the dust and hunted
flies.</p>

<p>The roar of the docks surged through dull and
confused, a medley of clanking hatch-covers, complaining
tackle, deep-throated protests of donkey-engines,
outlandish commands from stevedores, and
the yelps of high-strung little tugs bossing the
lighters.</p>

<p>Vanderzee pottered at his books behind the bar,
smoking a china pipe. His watchful eye was on his
Chinese boy polishing the brasswork of the taps. The
last of the noon idlers had gone, and the door leading
to the Mole was shut against the hot breeze lifting from
the sun's glare on the river.</p>

<p>Then a beam of light whipped across the floor with a
shuffle of feet on the stone steps outside. Captain
Dinshaw tottered in, gasping for breath and shaking
with excitement.</p>

<p>"Van!" he cried, weakly, making for the bar. "I'm
rich!"</p>

<p>The black man grunted, and put his pipe in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
mouth, staring past Dinshaw at the door as if he expected
to see a pursuing party burst in and attack the
old man, who seemed spent from running.</p>

<p>"Who's der drouble?" he growled. "For v'y you
roon?"</p>

<p>"I've hauled the wind!" cried Dinshaw, dropping
his parcel on the bar, and throwing up his hands in a
gesture of wild delight.</p>

<p>"My luck's turned! I'm a rich man, I tell ye!"</p>

<p>"Vell," remarked Vanderzee with stolid calm. "If
you puy a monkey in some oder blaces, don'd pring
him here to me. You vant me droubles to haff der
bolice mit, hey? A few trinks you get, der sun your
het in, und&mdash;dronk der Cuartel in und my license I
loose maype."</p>

<p>"I'll make ye rich!" persisted Dinshaw, in his high-pitched,
quivering voice, and giving no heed to the
admonitions of the black man and not in the least
disconcerted by the lack of welcome. "I'm goin' to
my island!"</p>

<p>"Der more kvicker, der more petter," said Vanderzee,
and humped his shoulders up with a convulsive
shrug. "Maype you prink it back und anchor it off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
der lighthouse, hey?"</p>

<p>"Jarrow'll take me in the <i>Nuestra</i>," continued Dinshaw,
now as if talking to himself. "I'll be rich and
have good soup for supper. I've got the tide this
time, an' no mistake. It's turned for me, as I allus
said it would, and Jarrow'll head out for my island.
I tell ye, man, it's all settled. Have ye seen Jarrow?"</p>

<p>"Charrow petter nod see you. Crassy you iss."</p>

<p>"He'll want to see me, an' don't forget," said Dinshaw,
wagging his head. "Jarrow's the man for me
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The <i>tapa</i> curtains were thrust aside violently, and
the short, squat man with clipped hair stood between
them, glowering, one hand gripped into a fist, and the
other holding the swaying fabric.</p>

<p>"What's this of me and the <i>Nuestra</i>?" he roared.
His moustaches puffed out at each word, and his jaw
lifted to a pugnacious angle as he threw back his
head. He screwed up his eyes into a sort of malevolent
grin which did not extend below the bridge of
his nose.</p>

<p>Dinshaw blinked at him for a minute, taken aback
by the picture of this man, who seemed about to charge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
into the room after him.</p>

<p>"You said you'd go," said Dinshaw.</p>

<p>"You lay off this blasted chin-chin about me and my
schooner!" raged Jarrow. "I've heard enough of it!"</p>

<p>"But I'm in soundin's, cap'n. We're bound out in
the <i>Nuestra</i> for the island! We're goin&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Git out!" snapped Jarrow, and clumping out into
the room, lifted a hairy fist at the old man. But Dinshaw
held his ground, and as Vanderzee cried out to
take care, the captain merely pushed the old man
back with a snort of rage.</p>

<p>"But it's all settled, I tell ye!" insisted Dinshaw.
"Hard and fast. We're to go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then go!" snarled Jarrow. "Go jump off the
Mole, and give me some rest and quiet. I got other
things to 'tend to. How'm I to git a charter for the
<i>Nuestra</i>, with you and yer slack jaw runnin' wild up
and down the waterfront tellin' all hands and the
ship's cook I'm goin' to yer blasted island in my
schooner? Hop in the river, but keep clear o' me and
mine! Won't have it from ye!"</p>

<p>"Der sun his het in," said Vanderzee, with a significant
nod toward Dinshaw. He wanted to avoid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
trouble. "He iss crassy."</p>

<p>The tall, thin man now parted the curtains and
came out, his long legs moving stiffly across the floor.
He glanced at Dinshaw with a sneering, wicked eye and
sniffed contemptuously. He gave the twisted straw
hat to Jarrow, who pulled it open and clamped it over
his clipped skull. They both turned to the bar.</p>

<p>"Ye said ye'd go," piped Dinshaw. "Ye allus said
ye'd take me, an' now's the chance. I ain't goin' to
stay with Prayerful Jones no more. I'm goin to pack
my dunnage an' take it aboard the <i>Nuestra</i>."</p>

<p>"There ye go!" cried Jarrow, swinging toward him,
and extending a brawny arm wrathfully. "Ye make
fast to me like a devilfish! That's the tune ye've been
singin' for years! '<i>Said ye'd go!</i>' Same old story!
Why, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, as if at a loss for words to express his
disgust, and pulled a cigar from his pocket. He bit
the end from it with a twisting motion of his head.
The tall man sighed wearily.</p>

<p>"Ach!" said Vanderzee. "No harm. Who iss to
giff mind to vat he say? He iss crassy."</p>

<p>"There's a-plenty to give mind to it," snarled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Jarrow. "Didn't I lose a charter last dry season to
bring wood from Mindoro? What with this booby-bird
goin' round Manila with word I'm to take the
<i>Nuestra</i> to his fool island, who's to want my boat?
Here I am now, lookin' to sign up a gover'ment hay
charter, and he'll put me high and dry if this word is
passed along again. I won't have it. I'll see the
police."</p>

<p>"Can't ye let me tell&mdash;&mdash;?" began Dinshaw.</p>

<p>"Come along of me, Peth," said Jarrow. The
angular man, who had arranged the upper part of his
body in such manner that the bar afforded possibilities
for rest, unfolded himself and moved toward his companion.</p>

<p>"I'll make ye all rich," wailed Dinshaw.</p>

<p>"You'll cost me a pretty penny, that's what!" exploded
Jarrow, turning back from the door. "I never
said I'd take ye, and ye can git that out of yer fool
head! Here I am, kickin' my heels around port and
my schooner feedin' barnacles off the breakwater, all
'cause ye've got somethin' chafin' yer top-hamper. I
won't stand for it no more."</p>

<p>"But I got a man to take us," pleaded Dinshaw, going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
after him. "A man said he'd charter the <i>Nuestra</i>
and we'd all go. Two men and a lady it was, up at
the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've heard enough of yer cock-and-bull yarns,"
retorted Jarrow, who was not averse to freeing his
mind on Dinshaw. "What the devil do ye want to
make fast to me fer! I don't want ye traversin' round
charterin' my schooner and me. Makin' jokes for the
loafers up on the canal. Ye done that once before, and
ye'll do it again. I'll have the police on ye! It's
about time Prayerful Jones was shut of lettin' loose his
bums and lunatics on us folks with property."</p>

<p>"No harm," said Vanderzee, soothingly.</p>

<p>"I say it is harm! I'm hailed whurever I go about
this business of the old un's island, Van! Just 'cause
I've got a schooner, it's Jarrow, Jarrow, Jarrow! I'd
look fine and smart cruisin' round for a P. D. island,
wouldn't I? Now tell me that?"</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" cried Dinshaw. "Them geodetic
youngsters didn't look for my island, an' what's more,
they wouldn't know it if they found it. That's why
they come back with a 'Position Doubtful' report.
Think I'm goin' to let them young whippersnappers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
know about my island so they can find it? Find it!
I can find it with a bone quadrant and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Find Tophet!" yelled Jarrow, and turned to the
door.</p>

<p>"Look here!" shouted Dinshaw, reaching into his
pocket and fishing out the bill he got from Locke for his
picture. "I can prove it! Here's money, planked
down, and more where it comes from. I'm to go, I
tell ye, an' if ye don't want none of it, I'll see Hood
about a boat. I thought ye was a friend of mine,
Jarrow, so I come to ye. This man I got could buy
your old schooner and a hundred like her, an' never
miss the money. He asked for a boat and I said
Jarrow, an' when the young lady asked who's to
skipper it, I said Jarrow's the man, an' Peth for mate,
an' he sung out for me to bring ye up to the tavern an'
sign the charter. I'll say no more&mdash;I'll see Hood."</p>

<p>"What's this?" demanded Jarrow, turning back to
stare at the bill. Vanderzee leaned over the bar, and
Peth craned his neck forward, maintaining his eternal
grin. They had never seen Dinshaw with so much
wealth before.</p>

<p>"Money!" piped Dinshaw, triumphantly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Has he gone plumb <i>loco</i>?" asked Jarrow, looking
at Vanderzee.</p>

<p>"Dot money ain'd crassy," said the black man.</p>

<p>"Where'd ye git it?" asked Jarrow, reluctantly
gentle.</p>

<p>"A rich man at the Bay View&mdash;with a young lady
and a young man in a helmet. I told 'em about the
<i>Wetherall</i> and they give me this money to buy clothes,
and sent me on the run for you. They want to go to
the Golden Isle. I better see what Hood's got for
charter."</p>

<p>"You better stay right here," said Jarrow, pushing
Dinshaw back toward the bar. "I'm goin' to look into
this."</p>

<p>"I'll see Hood," persisted Dinshaw.</p>

<p>"Luff!" commanded Jarrow, holding out his arms
to head Dinshaw off from the door. "You'll see me!
You've been usin' me and my schooner long enough,
and if there's anything in this yarn of yours, it's mine.
Who's this man?"</p>

<p>"He's a rich man, and he'll take us," said Dinshaw.</p>

<p>"I'd believe ye sooner if ye said ye saw pink elephants,"
said Jarrow. "Git down to cases. What's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
his name?"</p>

<p>"Money talks," suggested Vanderzee.</p>

<p>"Moonshine!" declared Peth.</p>

<p>"His name's Locke," said Dinshaw. "Will ye go,
Jarrow? I'll make ye all rich."</p>

<p>"Now what did this Locke man say?" demanded
Jarrow. "I don't want any ravin's. I want facts,
straight out, so you come up into the wind. What'd
he say?"</p>

<p>"He said to look sharp about it," said Dinshaw,
blinking at Jarrow, a trifle confused at being questioned.
"Stores and crew&mdash;right away, and be ready
to sail in a day's time. We don't want no soldierin' on
the job. It's to be up hook and away and look lively.
You'll have to move navy style, Jarrow. You know
me."</p>

<p>"Thinks I'm foremast in his brig," said Jarrow,
with a leer at Vanderzee.</p>

<p>"You better cut over across the river," said Dinshaw,
"and tell him you're ready and you'll have the
<i>Nuestra</i> alongside the Mole by dark to take on stores,
or he'll have another boat. He said somethin' about
knowin' a man out here who had a yacht, comin' down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
from Japan."</p>

<p>"Smoke," said Peth.</p>

<p>"I wonder," remarked Jarrow, scratching his head.
"Sure ye didn't lift that ten-<i>peso</i> bill from Prayerful
Jones? I'll be bugs myself if I listen to you."</p>

<p>"Hood'll listen," said Dinshaw, crisply, and made
a new effort to reach the door.</p>

<p>"Vhy don'd you to der Pay Few go?" suggested
Vanderzee.</p>

<p>Jarrow looked at himself. "I'd have to shift my
duds," he said, "and I ain't for huntin' sharks' eggs on
Looney's say. What ye think, Peth? Shall we fill up
that way?"</p>

<p>"I ain't no hand for them swells," said Peth. "You
go, cap'n, an' I'll stand by down here with Dinshaw."</p>

<p>"Vait!" said Vanderzee, holding up a black hand.
"Vot's der name? Locke!" He stepped into a tiny
office behind the bar. They heard him asking the clerk
at the Bay View if there was a man named Locke staying
there. In an instant he was back again, grinning.</p>

<p>"Iss!" he exclaimed. "So soon I know, I hang
opp."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jarrow, who was still in doubt as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
what he should do, "that's somethin' to know. Maybe
some rich tourist did fall for Looney's yarn."</p>

<p>Peth went back to the bar and leaned against it as
if he had made up his mind not to move until Jarrow
reached some decision.</p>

<p>"By the Mighty Nelson, I've got a twist in my
chains to take a run over to the hotel!"</p>

<p>"Shoot," said Peth, displaying more interest than
he had at any time since Dinshaw had arrived.</p>

<p>"Come along, Peth," said Jarrow. "I'll git into
some fresh duds, and you brail yerself up to look smart,
and we'll drift over in a <i>carromata</i>. Will you wait
here, Dinshaw?"</p>

<p>"I'll wait, Jarrow, I'll wait. Tell him I sent ye, and
he'll know. It's all settled right enough if you lay
alongside and make fast, and no time lost."</p>

<p>"See that he don't git away," Jarrow whispered to
Vanderzee. "I can't take no chances with this&mdash;and
keep him quiet&mdash;in there."</p>

<p>Pointing to the alcove, Jarrow slipped out through
the door, followed by Peth, close at heel, like a well-trained
dog behind his master.</p>

<p>"It's this way," said Jarrow, as they made their way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
between the bales and barrels among the workers on
the Mole. "Maybe Looney give 'em hot shot about
this island and they're keen to go, thinkin' there's
bunches of gold there, which I know ain't so. But it
don't matter if we git a charter at fifty a day or so, and
drag it out into a couple of weeks."</p>

<p>"We'll want our own crew," suggested Peth.</p>

<p>"Bevins," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"Shope," said Peth.</p>

<p>"And Doc Bird for steward, and Shanghai Tom
ships as cook."</p>

<p>"Right. Ye leave it to me, and if there's anything
in it, I'll have all hands come dark."</p>

<p>"I ain't hatchin' no chickens on what Looney said,"
cautioned Jarrow, "but if there's a man who's lit up
on Looney's island-o'-gold yarn, it ain't my way to
throw sand in his eyes. And if we do find gold that's
two tails to the cat. We'll take things as they lay."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Captain Jarrow Goes Cruising in Strange Waters</span></h2>


<p>Captain Jarrow and Mr. Peth were driven
across the Bridge of Spain and up Bagumbayan
Drive past the Walled City in a
<i>carromata</i>, and disembarked from the native rig at the
edge of the Luneta, whence they proceeded to the
Bay View Hotel.</p>

<p>Jarrow wore a new white suit, squeaky French shoes
of yellow hue, and an aura of perfumed soap. Mr.
Peth felt uncomfortably respectable in blue serge and a
shirt with a starched collar.</p>

<p>"I might ha' stayed back," grumbled Peth, as they
mounted the stoop of the deserted veranda.</p>

<p>"You lay a course for the bar while I brace the gent
at the office," said Jarrow. "Don't have nothin' to
say."</p>

<p>Mr. Peth measured the veranda with his long legs
and disappeared into the bar, while Jarrow squeaked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
his way into the palms and velvet grandeur of the <i>sala</i>,
waving away the boy who came to inquire about his
baggage.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Wilkins, rising from behind the
railed desk.</p>

<p>"You got a man here named Locke," asserted
Jarrow, seizing the railing as if to brace himself against
a shock.</p>

<p>"Right-o," said Wilkins. "Name, please?" He
reached for the room telephone.</p>

<p>Jarrow was taken aback at the thought of being so
abruptly thrust before a stranger he could not see.
He had no plan for a telephone conversation as preliminary
to a meeting and was averse to having his
name bandied about by the clerk.</p>

<p>"You can say," he suggested, "it's a friend of
Captain Dinshaw's, who's come to have a word with
him&mdash;strictly private."</p>

<p>Wilkins pressed a button, and after a few seconds
announced: "Mr. Locke, there's a gentleman here to
see you from Captain Dinshaw. He wants to speak to
you privately."</p>

<p>"Put him on the wire," said Locke. "Hello! I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
guess you've got the wrong party."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Jarrow. "I was sent to see you.
I'm from Captain Dinshaw."</p>

<p>"Don't know him," said Locke. "What's it
about?"</p>

<p>"The island," said Jarrow, still cautious.</p>

<p>"Island! Oh, yes, the old fellow with the picture.
All right, come on up."</p>

<p>Jarrow was soon before the door of the Lockes' suite
and was ushered into a room which overlooked the bay,
the windows open and the awnings down. He saw
a young woman seated before a small table covered
with tea things, and a tall young man standing near by.
Mr. Locke stood just inside the door, but what warmed
Jarrow's heart and bolstered his courage was a picture
of Dinshaw's island which lay on a divan. There
was the proof that the old captain had talked with
these people.</p>

<p>Locke regarded his visitor with a puzzled air, but
concealed his surprise. The stranger seemed to him to
be strangely furtive and sinister, standing in the half-light,
ears twitching, a clipped skull thrust forward on
a short neck like the head of a turtle pushing out from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a shell.</p>

<p>"I didn't get your name, sir," said Locke, in a
friendly way, to save his guest embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Jarrow's my name. I got a wreckin' business.
You ask anybody in Manila about me."</p>

<p>"And you say Dinshaw sent you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I take it you've had a talk with him."</p>

<p>"So I have."</p>

<p>"Then it's all right. Understand he mentioned me."</p>

<p>"You are Captain Jarrow? And you have a
schooner?" asked Trask.</p>

<p>"Jarrow!" exclaimed Marjorie. "Of course! Don't
you remember, Dad? Captain Dinshaw told us about
Captain Jarrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes," said Locke. "You're the man he
said would go to his island. This is my daughter,
Miss Marjorie&mdash;and Mr. Trask."</p>

<p>Jarrow ducked his head. Locke had introduced the
others more for the purpose of gaining time to study
this hulking, limp-kneed man who stood before him
like a gorilla crouched for a spring and squeezing a
soft straw hat into a shapeless lump in his hands.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?" asked Locke, and took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
his hat. Jarrow allowed himself to sink carefully
into a gold-backed chair of doubtful strength and
capacity.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'll take a cup of tea," suggested
Marjorie.</p>

<p>"No, thanks, ma'am. I don't eat nothin' much between
meals. See you've been buyin' some of the old
cap'n's pictures. He's a oddity, but there's gold on
that island of his, right enough."</p>

<p>"Think so?" asked Trask.</p>

<p>"Know so. Scads of it. He brung back samples in
his pockets. I've told him time and time again I'd go
to his island, and what's more, I would ha', only I
don't own all my schooner. It's been busy up to now
with gover'ment work&mdash;hay for the cavalry posts
down south. But now I'm ready, and if I can arrange
a charter, I'll cut the rate to the bone, just to help Dinshaw&mdash;say
sixty-five a day, gold." He looked at Locke
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I don't know much about such things," said
Locke, vaguely.</p>

<p>"Well, a hundred a day is the usual rate," went on
Jarrow, "but I'll make it special just to help the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
man."</p>

<p>"I hope you're well repaid," said Locke. "If there
is gold&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gold!" exclaimed Jarrow. "Mr. Locke, ye're in
on a good thing, if you'll let me say a word about
it."</p>

<p>"I'm a little bit mixed up on this thing," said
Locke, with an amused smile at Trask. "You know
more about the proposition than I do, captain. Of
course, Captain Dinshaw talked with Mr. Trask&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hope I ain't put my foot in anything," broke in
Jarrow. "I thought from what Dinshaw said Mr.
Trask here knew all about it."</p>

<p>"Mr. Trask knows as much about it as I do, and
more," said Locke. "Say whatever you like."</p>

<p>"Then it's all right," said Jarrow, obviously relieved.
"'Tain't a piece of business I'd want to tell
Tom, Dick, and Harry, if I had the weather on it like
you have. I'm above board in my dealin's. You
ask anybody in Manila about Captain Jarrow, the
wrecker. But I thought for a minute I'd let the cat
out of the bag."</p>

<p>"No damage done," said Locke. "As I understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
it, you intend to go to this island of Dinshaw's."</p>

<p>"We're so glad to hear it, Captain Jarrow," said
Marjorie. "It will surely make the old man happy."</p>

<p>"Thank ye, ma'am. I want to kind o' apologize for
jammin' myself in like this, but I'm a frank man."</p>

<p>Jarrow paused, and throwing one foot over a knee,
stroked the seams of his new French shoes with the
tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>"Of course," he resumed, "Captain Dinshaw and
me, we're thick as three in a bed. Ask anybody in
Manila if I ain't been doin' my best to go to his island.
I've offered to take him to his island, time and time
again, but he wouldn't hear it, 'cause he knew I was
makin' money with the <i>Nuestra</i>&mdash;that's my schooner,
the <i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario</i>&mdash;me and Peth, my mate,
we own it with others. In the wreckin' business it's
touch and go. You got to be on the spot, and there
ain't been any too many wrecks out this way lately.
Let me go away for a week or two on this island business,
and I'd likely lose somethin' good. But with
somebody to kind o' go in on the deal, I'd split even at

if there wa'n't much gold there, but I look for findin'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
it in a big way. It's a open and shut proposition."</p>

<p>"It sounds interesting," said Locke, getting more
puzzled as to why Jarrow should call on him to take
him into his confidence regarding plans about Dinshaw's
island.</p>

<p>"There's big money in it," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"May I ask why you think so, Captain Jarrow?"
inquired Trask.</p>

<p>Jarrow turned to Trask in surprise. The question
was appallingly direct, and Trask's tone was crisp and
business-like.</p>

<p>"I know it," said Jarrow, uncomfortably aware of
being pinned down to definite information.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand why you should take the
trouble to tell us about your proposed trip," said
Locke.</p>

<p>"How?" Jarrow's head snapped up suddenly and his
eyes opened in a wide stare at Locke.</p>

<p>"What is the purpose of this interview?" demanded
Locke. "There seems to be some sort of mistake."</p>

<p>Jarrow put his foot down slowly and sucked his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
moustache in between his lips. His ears twitched and
his head ducked forward as he made a swallowing
movement with his throat.</p>

<p>"How's that again?" he whispered, as if he had lost
his voice.</p>

<p>"From what you've said, captain, I gather you
believe I have something to do with the matter of the
island."</p>

<p>Jarrow blew his moustache and gave a suppressed
sigh of agony.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, Dinshaw&mdash;he told me you wanted me
and my schooner to go to his island!"</p>

<p>Trask laughed outright in spite of his effort to keep
still, and Marjorie gave an exclamation of amazement.
Locke could only stare at Jarrow.</p>

<p>"Told you I wanted your schooner! He certainly is
crazy! Most absurd thing I ever heard of!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Peth, my mate, he's below now," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"Then you are going?" asked Trask.</p>

<p>"Am I goin'?" retorted Jarrow. "No! I can't go
on my own hook. I thought you folks was goin'&mdash;that's
what I'm here for."</p>

<p>"It's all a mistake," said Locke. "We had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
intention of misleading the old man."</p>

<p>"It will be a terrible disappointment to him,"
said Marjorie. "It's a ghastly mistake if poor
old Captain Dinshaw really believes we told him
we'd go."</p>

<p>"We bought his picture out of charity," said Locke.
"Mr. Trask here is a mining man, and was interested
in his story, but we haven't any more idea of going to
this gold island than we have of going to the moon.
My daughter and I are leaving the day after to-morrow
for Hong Kong to connect with the Pacific
Mail. We were going this morning, but missed the
<i>Taming</i>."</p>

<p>"This'll just about kill old man Dinshaw," said
Jarrow.</p>

<p>"He's so pathetic," said Marjorie. "I'm sorry if
we've done anything to disappoint him. I'll always
feel guilty about it. Just what did he say, Captain
Jarrow?"</p>

<p>"Why, ma'am, he comes runnin' down to the
Cuartel not an hour ago, all excited up about you
people. 'Jarrow,' he says to me, 'I've got a party
who'll go to my island if they can git your schooner&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
yours is the only one to be had for love or money.
I know you'll lose on it, seein's you got a new gover'ment
hay charter comin' your way, but can't you
strain a p'int for an old friend? If you don't stand by
me, the chance is gone.'</p>

<p>"'Cap'n Dinshaw,' says I to him, 'I'll stand by if
I can be any help, lose money or no. If me and my
schooner's what you need, why, she's lyin' off the
breakwater, and I'm your man.' And Peth, my mate,
he speaks up, and says to him: 'Dinny, don't you fret
none, but leave it to Jarrow. He's the man to tie
to if ye need help.'</p>

<p>"So we lays a course for up here. When he hears of
this, it'll just about kill him dead, sure. Happened the
same way once before, and he was laid up in the Civil
Hospital for a month with brain fever. He ain't as
strong now as he was then, neither. If I had the
capital, I'd go in on my own, but I'm up to my ears in
debt, and as I said, I'd just about split even at sixty-five
dollars a day. But I can't go it alone. The old
man he'll just fade away and die, if you don't mind my
puttin' in my oar about it. When he gits these idees
about somebody goin' to his island, and then it falls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
through, he moans and moans&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Dad, I wish something could be done!" cried
Marjorie. "I'll never forgive myself if we go away
from here and leave that old man grieving!" She
looked at Trask and caught a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll send him back to the States if you feel
that way about it," said Locke.</p>

<p>"He won't go," said Jarrow. "We've all tried to
send him home. I offered to buy his ticket some time
back, but he's got this island on the brain."</p>

<p>"Where is the island?" asked Trask. "I understand
it isn't far."</p>

<p>"Oh, up the coast a piece," said Jarrow. "Take a
week, say, to go and come back."</p>

<p>"A week!" said Locke. "I had an idea it was a
long way off."</p>

<p>"Shucks!" said Jarrow. "No great shakes of a
ways. With favourin' winds, a week would do it easy.
Of course, if a man wanted to spend a lot of time there,
diggin' around, that's a cat of another colour. But
with a couple of days to look the place over in good
shape, ten days would do it easy."</p>

<p>"Dad, why can't we go?" asked Marjorie. "Just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to make Dinshaw happy! You said I might go any
place I wanted to on this trip."</p>

<p>"You mean to tell me you want to go schoonering
around out in this country, Marge?" Locke was
astounded.</p>

<p>"It would be great fun."</p>

<p>"Great guns!" said Locke. "Don't you know a
schooner isn't what a liner is? You can't have suites
and stewards and fancy things to eat."</p>

<p>"You'll find it comfortable enough on the <i>Nuestra</i>,"
said Jarrow, his hopes rising. "A good Chink cook,
a coloured steward, all hands a room to theirselves.
All Cap'n Dinshaw needs is a mouthful of sea-air an'
a deck under his feet. There's a whallopin' lot of gold
there, too, or I miss stays. I know nobody believes
him, but they didn't believe Columbus. I can't
guarantee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Trask, "if we can make the right sort
of a deal."</p>

<p>"If you go, I'm in on it," declared Locke.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dad, you're a brick! I knew you'd go!"</p>

<p>Trask took Locke aside, to confer privately. "I
want you to come, Mr. Locke," he said, "but I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
want to have you stand an expense which may be a
dead loss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't go unless I can stand half," said Locke.</p>

<p>"Very well, but I'd rather not appear in the matter
as the leader, because if I did, the newspapers would
find out who I am and make it appear that my company
was backing Dinshaw. I haven't authority to
go on this trip, and if it turned out badly, a failure
would be credited against the Consolidated, and it's
a very conservative company. Here's a thousand
dollars. Will you draw checks against it at your
bank? And I'll go as your guest?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Locke. "I have an account
current at the Chinese bank, which was to be transferred
to Hong Kong, but I'll hold it here."</p>

<p>"All right. You give Jarrow a check as an advance
and to buy supplies. We'll close the deal right now."</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Jarrow Does and Says Queer Things</span></h2>


<p>Mr. Peth was slinking about the bar like
a leopard on a still hunt when Captain Jarrow
returned from his conference which resulted
in a tentative charter of the <i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del
Rosario</i>, with himself as master and Peth as mate.</p>

<p>Jarrow was in a state bordering between exhaltation
at his success and collapse over the narrow margin by
which he had put through a deal which at one time
appeared as elusive as a chimera.</p>

<p>"Give me a Picon, and make it strong," said Jarrow
to the bar-boy, disregarding Peth, while he scrubbed
his face with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Hook up?" asked Peth, edging along the bar until
he had an elbow against Jarrow's side.</p>

<p>"Mighty Nelson!" whispered Jarrow. "It was a
lee shore, and no mistake. Looney lied."</p>

<p>"Lied!" whispered Peth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"They never told him they wanted us," continued
Jarrow, with due caution, glancing about the deserted
bar. "But I put it through. They're swells and no
mistake."</p>

<p>"Then it's a go, skipper?"</p>

<p>"We get out in the morning. It's to be quiet. We
clear for Vigan with passengers. Take rock ballast
this afternoon, and git stores aboard. Locke give me
free rein for everything needed, and I'm to draw on
him at the Hong Kong-Shanghai bank. We ought to
clean up. Pipe down, here's the dude clerk."</p>

<p>"You saw Mr. Locke?" asked Wilkins, with a genial
air, as he came in from the office, consumed with
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Jarrow. "He's a nice man."</p>

<p>"Raw-ther," said Wilkins.</p>

<p>"I hear he's rich," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>Wilkins smiled knowingly. "Millions," he said.</p>

<p>Peth looked at Jarrow quickly, and whistled faintly
through his teeth.</p>

<p>"I guess you know me," said Jarrow. "I been up
here a few times now and then on business."</p>

<p>"You're a Manila man, aren't you?" asked Wilkins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
"I don't place your name but your face is familiar."</p>

<p>"I'm Captain Jarrow, head of the Inter-Island
Wreckin' Company. I got a big business, in a way.
Everybody knows me in my line. I'm the man who
done the divin' for the gover'ment."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Wilkins.</p>

<p>"I'd like for you to say a good word for me, if it falls
your way, to this Mr. Locke&mdash;and Trask."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Wilkins.</p>

<p>"Who does this Mr. Trask happen to be?" asked
Jarrow.</p>

<p>"Mining man," said Wilkins.</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"Yes, he was talking with Looney Dinshaw. Seems
he came out here from China to look after the island.
I knew him down in Colombo, when I managed a
hotel."</p>

<p>"Lookin' for the island!" exclaimed Jarrow.
"That's news to me."</p>

<p>"I thought maybe that's why you called," said
Wilkins.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe I didn't and maybe I did. I have to
keep a closed mouth. But if you'll say a word for me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to these people&mdash;reliable and all that&mdash;I may put
somethin' your way sometime."</p>

<p>"I'll have a gin," said Peth.</p>

<p>"Glad to do what I can, sir," said Wilkins. "Support
home industry, that's always been my motto. If
I'm asked, I'll say the right sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Good for you," said Jarrow. "This is Mr. Peth,
my mate. We got to slide," and waving his hand at
Wilkins, Jarrow walked toward the veranda while
Peth gulped his gin and trailed after him with alacrity.</p>

<p>The mate overtook the captain as the latter headed
across the Luneta toward Malecon Drive, where the
great king palms offered shade from the blinding sunlight.</p>

<p>Jarrow marched along, with head down, staring at
the gravel. He gave no heed to Peth, who overtook
him and fell in beside him.</p>

<p>"Millions," said Peth, presently.</p>

<p>"You ain't got the brains of a goose, Peth."</p>

<p>"What's the row?" demanded Peth.</p>

<p>"Can't you hear millions spoke of without actin'
like a blasted whistlin' buoy?" demanded Jarrow, savagely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was took aback," said Peth.</p>

<p>"Took aback! This ain't no business for a man
who's got to blow off steam in public the minute he
sniffs somethin' good! Things like that might bust up
the whole business&mdash;and sixty a day in it!"</p>

<p>"I don't see what I done, skipper," whined Peth.</p>

<p>"You done enough. Couldn't you see what I was
drivin' at? You ain't got half an eye. That dude
clerk, he can fix us solid with them people. What if he
got an idea we was out to make money off 'em? This
Locke'll go askin' that feller, so I had to prime him.
Lucky he didn't notice your fidgets when he spoke of
millions."</p>

<p>"You go make a mountain out of it," said Peth, as
they turned into the Malecon and proceeded toward
the river.</p>

<p>"Peth, you better not cross the bows of these
people till we're ready for sea."</p>

<p>Peth turned his sharp face toward the captain and
looked down on him with searching eyes, a trifle
startled. He turned away and spat viciously.
"I won't bite 'em," he growled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"They might bite you. We can't reckon on what
these swells'll cotton to in a deal like this."</p>

<p>"Aint I big enough dude?"</p>

<p>"You ain't got no diplomacy."</p>

<p>Peth gritted his teeth gently. "Don't ye want me
for mate?" he demanded, with a poor attempt to conceal
his wrath.</p>

<p>"What's the matter of you?" asked Jarrow, looking
at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"You that's sayin' it. You talk like I'm a horned
toad or somethin', to set folks on the run the minute
they clap eyes on me."</p>

<p>"Have sense," cautioned Jarrow. "We got a lot to
do come sundown. Have sense. I'm the brain's,
ain't I?"</p>

<p>"So you say, cap'n."</p>

<p>"I got my own meanin's. What if this Trask and
the girl come down aboard this evenin' to look things
over, and they don't like your looks first off?"</p>

<p>"What's my looks got to do with it? Ain't I
dressed up?"</p>

<p>"Yes, good enough for me, but maybe not for them.
They'll put a hole in our copper plates, charter or no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
charter, if they take a dislike to you. We can't take
no chances."</p>

<p>"Might as well see me first as last."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Plenty of reasons for 'em comin' about
on the whole business and leavin' us high and dry,
except for the advance. They hop aboard a liner&mdash;what
then?"</p>

<p>"Got to see me some time."</p>

<p>"Sure! Once to sea, they'll take things as they find
'em. But it's touch and go with us until we clear the
bay, and don't forget that for a minute."</p>

<p>"What they want? Sody water gents for a crew?"</p>

<p>"Whatever they want, they'll have it, them swells."</p>

<p>"Then I ain't gallant enough for the likes o' you and
this charter party, I take it," said Peth, his anger rising.</p>

<p>"I ain't findin' no fault with you myself, Peth. All
I'm gallied about is what the others'll think. You're
goin' mate, of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Peth, curtly. "You talk like I was
ship's boy, not owner of an eighth of the <i>Nuestra</i>.
Who helped you salve her? Who like to broke his
back doin' of it? Peth did, that's who. Now he ain't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
good enough, once ye make fast to a millionaire."</p>

<p>"You talk like an old mitten with the thumb brailed
up," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"Where was this millionaire feller when ye wanted a
man to stand by and raise the <i>Nuestra</i>, I'd like&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Belay that!" said Jarrow. "I'm talkin' for yer
own good. There's money in this cruise for both of us.
I got my own reasons, and that's enough. I'd look
smart cuttin' you out of things, wouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say, cap'n, ye don't need to take me
mate if ye don't want to."</p>

<p>"Steady as she goes," said Jarrow, taking him by
his arm. "You're mate, and I never had it my mind
ye wouldn't go mate."</p>

<p>"All right, all right," growled Peth, shaking himself
free. "I ain't goin' to fuss none. I don't want to be
gammin' around with swells, no ways. But if I
thought ye wanted to beach me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, git that out of yer head. You've got to git
the crew together and I got to see Prayerful Jones afore
Dinshaw gits back. Then I'll git the old man aboard
and keep his jaw close to the wind. We got to run
this thing on some basis. You'll find Doc Bird cookin'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
in a civilian mess out Malate way. We got to have
him."</p>

<p>"Will Doc cut loose from a shore berth for what
looks like a v'yage to Vigan?"</p>

<p>"He'll cut loose from anything if he knows I want
him," said Jarrow, in a tone significant of no doubts
about the matter. "He's to be aboard in the mornin'&mdash;to-night
would be better. When we git our ballast
we'll lay out in the stream again. It's safer from
talk."</p>

<p>"How safer?"</p>

<p>"From folks nosin' around. We can't have none of
the crew hangin' 'longshore, ginnin' up. I'll fix the
clearance myself, and see the commissioner."</p>

<p>"But I'm to have who I want for'ard," said Peth.</p>

<p>"That's it. You know who we want."</p>

<p>They hailed a <i>banca</i> and were rowed across the river,
making a landing over a tier of <i>cascos</i>.</p>

<p>"I'll go over to the Cuartel and pass the word for
the men and do a little lookin' myself," said Peth.</p>

<p>"Keep Dinshaw there half an hour," suggested
Jarrow.</p>

<p>Peth looked at him suspiciously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the game?"</p>

<p>"Never mind me or the game."</p>

<p>"I seem to be kind o' out on the aidge o' things,"
growled the mate.</p>

<p>"You keep Dinshaw from shootin' off his face, that's
all you got to do, and don't let Van know how things
swung at the Bay View. I'm goin' to keep this business
under gratin's."</p>

<p>"You don't need to fret," said Peth. "I ain't fixin'
to break nothin' out," and he tracked away to the
Cuartel, weaving in and out among the litter of goods
on the Mole.</p>

<p>Jarrow stood and watched him disappear into the
Cuartel. "I ain't never had no luck with him," he
remarked. "I hope he breaks his fool neck, that's
what I hope. He'll mess things up for me yit."</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Mr. Peth Is Particular About Where He Sleeps</span></h2>


<p>Early in the morning, when Manila was turning
over for another nap, a victoria from the
Bay View took Locke, Trask, and Marjorie
over the Bridge of Spain and through Plaza Moraga to
the landing steps, where the tug which was to take the
<i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario</i> to sea was waiting to put
the voyagers aboard the schooner. The <i>Nuestra</i> was
at anchor down the bay.</p>

<p>As they got out of the carriage a black man hopped
ashore from the tug and made for their baggage.</p>

<p>"I'm Doc Bird, the steward," he said. "I reckon
yo' all is fo' Cap'n Jarrow's packet?"</p>

<p>"We are," said Locke. "Is everything ready?"</p>

<p>"Never gon' be no readier, sir," said the steward,
who looked smart in a suit of white and a jaunty cap.
Instead of a shirt, he wore a gaudy cotton sweater
with stripes running athwart his body, red and blue,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
after the manner of a convict's clothes.</p>

<p>"Then we're off," said Locke, as he helped Marjorie
aboard, while Trask superintended the job of getting
their bags aboard, at which task the native crew of
the tug assisted the steward.</p>

<p>In a minute they were heading down the river. As
they cleared the old transport docks they made out
the <i>Nuestra</i> well off the breakwater, her brown, bare
masts rising like spires from her black hull, and the
morning sun glinting from a strip of brass on her taffrail.
They could see busy figures aboard, and as they
drew nearer Captain Jarrow appeared on the poop-deck
smoking a cigar. He was all in white, his queer
cockle-shell straw hat fastened to a button of his coat
by a cord.</p>

<p>They had visited the schooner the night before,
under the pilotage of Jarrow, before Locke had signed
the agreement which was practically a charter, at sixty
dollars a day. She had six rooms in her main cabin
in addition to the galley and lazarette, and while they
were small, they were comfortable enough and satisfactory.</p>

<p>No one was aboard during the brief visit, but Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Bevins, the second mate, and one man of the crew.
Bevins's manners were ingratiating and he wore a
constant smile, due more to some defect of his facial
muscles than chronic geniality. The other man was a
big fellow with much tattooing on his hands and wrists.
Captain Jarrow summoned him to the cabin door and
introduced him as "Shope, who was to go b'sun."</p>

<p>"There's Captain Dinshaw!" cried Marjorie, as the
<i>patron</i> steered the tug to come alongside.</p>

<p>Dinshaw had popped up over the starboard bulwark,
and watched the tug maneuver with critical eye.</p>

<p>"And all dressed up," said Trask, smiling, as he observed
that Dinshaw wore a white suit and sported an
official-looking cap with a white top.</p>

<p>"The old man shore thinks he's the skipper," remarked
Doc Bird.</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked Locke.</p>

<p>"He's a-bossin' everybody," replied the steward.
"Thinks he's in his old brig what he lost on his island."</p>

<p>"The old dear!" said Marjorie. "Isn't he pathetic?
He looks thoroughly happy!"</p>

<p>Dinshaw stood with his hands on the bulwark, and
looked down at the tug, his head askew like an observant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
fowl.</p>

<p>"Don't scratch the paint!" he shouted to the
<i>patron</i> of the tug. "Mind what ye're at!"</p>

<p>"Paint!" laughed Locke. "Couldn't hurt that
paint with a crowbar."</p>

<p>"Glad to see ye in good time, Mr. Locke," called
Jarrow, and then stepped back to escape the smoke
from the tug's funnel, calling to Peth to see that the
ladder was put over.</p>

<p>After a deal of fussing and bawling on the part of the
tug's crew, she was nestled alongside the schooner, and
Jarrow was at the rail to assist them over the side.</p>

<p>"I told ye I'd go," said Dinshaw, proudly, taking
off his cap to Marjorie as she jumped down to the deck.
"This lady knows, and she wanted to go to my island.
Thank ye, ma'am! Good mornin'."</p>

<p>"Indeed I do want to go," laughed Marjorie. "And
I hope we'll find your island, too, captain."</p>

<p>"Thank ye, ma'am. We'll find it right enough,"
and with a hasty bow he waddled forward importantly,
to oversee the getting of the anchor and the
passing of the towing hawser.</p>

<p>But the tug remained alongside after Locke and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Trask had climbed over into the waist and the baggage
was transferred by Doc Bird.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Jarrow, as the <i>patron</i> mounted the
ladder and grinned at them, hat in hand, "this boy
wants his towage."</p>

<p>"How much?" asked Locke, taking out a large roll
of yellow American bills.</p>

<p>"I'd give him a check," advised Jarrow, "if you've
got your book."</p>

<p>"All right," said Locke, and he followed Jarrow into
the cabin while Trask and Marjorie went to the poop-deck.
The <i>Nuestra</i> looked clean as a pin and fresh as
a maker's model. Her decks had been scrubbed until
the caulking in the seams looked like lines of black
paint on old ivory. Her standing rigging had been
newly tarred, her bright work polished, and the water
casks lashed in the waist had their hoops painted a
bright yellow, not yet dry. New hemp hung in the
belaying pins. The roof of the cabin, covered by a
tarpaulin, gleamed with oil and yellow paint. She had
been scrubbed and freshened until she had quite the
aspect of a yacht.</p>

<p>"This beats waiting around Hong Kong," said Marjorie,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
as they stood looking forward. She looked
quite nautical in a suit of white duck and a yachting
cap pinned to her flaxen hair. Trask thought she
appeared entrancingly healthy and "out of doors."</p>

<p>"It's going to be a jolly fine trip," said Trask. "I
hope you'll enjoy it one hundredth as much as I do."</p>

<p>"But gold-mine hunting is no novelty to you," she
said.</p>

<p>"It's the first time I've actually gone to sea in search
of a gold mine. And there are other reasons which
make this trip unique."</p>

<p>"You are absurdly reticent, Mr. Trask."</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances it would be unfair to
state the facts in their blunt simplicity," he retorted,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"You mean father and me?"</p>

<p>"Mostly you," and he moved forward abruptly to
tell Doc Bird to put his bags in his room.</p>

<p>Locke and Jarrow came out of the main cabin and
paid off the <i>patron</i> of the tug.</p>

<p>"Well, we're off," said Locke, coming aft, as Jarrow
went forward to oversee the getting of the anchor and
the passing of the hawser. Bevins came aft presently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and took the wheel, and in a few minutes the <i>Nuestra</i>
started down the bay at the end of her leash.</p>

<p>Well under way, Jarrow called Peth to the main
cabin and introduced him to Marjorie, Locke, and
Trask, who had been summoned below for the assignment
of their rooms.</p>

<p>Peth stood in the doorway and bowed, looking quite
smart and respectable in clean dungarees, and though
he said nothing but "How de do," he gave the impression
of affability mixed with shyness. He missed no
detail of Trask's clothing, and seemed to measure
the young man's strength as he looked him up and
down.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Locke, you'll have this room aft, to
port, next is Mr. Locke, and then Mr. Trask. Then
comes the cabin stores. I'll be aft to starboard, Mr.
Peth and Captain Dinshaw next, the cook and the
steward, and the galley&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If ye don't mind, cap'n," interrupted Peth, "I'd
not want to bunk with the old man. I got to be up
and around nights."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jarrow. "There are two bunks in
Mr. Trask's room here. Maybe you wouldn't find it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
out of the way if Mr. Peth took the lower?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Trask. "I'll sleep soundly
enough."</p>

<p>"My gear's in there now," said Peth, and he went
out on deck.</p>

<p>"I'd git my stuff all opened up and stowed while
we're in the bay," suggested Jarrow. "There may be
a swell on outside, and then it's goin' to be hot below
as the sun climbs. Tom! How's that coffee comin'
on?"</p>

<p>The fat Chinese cook looked out from the galley, a
white cap on his head and an apron tied about him.
He grinned pleasantly, and replied that the coffee was
on the fire.</p>

<p>"We had breakfast," said Locke.</p>

<p>"I'd take a nip of coffee," said Jarrow. "Now
then, here's Doc Bird to help open your gear. Anything
you want, ask for it, and you, Doc, keep an eye
out to make all hands comfortable. I got to go up
now."</p>

<p>Trask followed the captain up the companion and
left Marjorie and her father below, until he was called
to have his coffee. When they went on deck again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Corregidor Island was astern, rising out of the channel
like a derelict battleship.</p>

<p>To starboard, close aboard beyond the stretch of
sun-dazzled sea, was the coast of Bataan, with the
brown fuzzy mountains behind Mariveles shouldering
into the sky. Point Luzon marked the limit of the
land over the starboard bow, and on the port side the
shining China Sea reached away to the horizon.</p>

<p>The jib and foresail were already set although the
tug had not cast off. Soon they began to fill, and as
Peth bawled to the tug, the hawser was dropped, and
tooting a farewell, the little boat swung in a wide arc
and headed back for Manila.</p>

<p>Peth came aft and routed Doc Bird from under the
mainsail boom where the steward sat peeling potatoes.
Dinshaw kept moving about, repeating the orders of
the mate, or talking to himself.</p>

<p>The crew were all white, in accordance with the
orders of Locke, who had declared that he did not want
to undertake the voyage with natives forward.</p>

<p>The breeze from landward died as the main was
being set, and the <i>Nuestra</i> began to roll gently as she
fell off. For a few minutes she threatened to follow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the tug back to Manila, with many lurches and angry
snappings of blocks.</p>

<p>"We'll git a clinkin' good breeze from the south'ard
when we're off the land," said Jarrow, glancing aloft
to the windvane on the mizzen truck. It was flopping
about like a dead fish on a gaff.</p>

<p>Before long the foresail began to fret its sheets, and
Bevins got her head to seaward. Then there came
from astern a hot, puffy breeze, and the schooner stood
out on a port tack, curvetting prettily as her sails were
trimmed and filled.</p>

<p>One of the crew, hailed as Pennock, now came aft
and took the wheel, and Bevins went forward. Captain
Dinshaw went into the cabin, and looking down,
Trask could see him bent over the table, sucking a stub
of a pencil and studying a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>"What's the bearin' and distance of Point Luzon?"
he called up the companion.</p>

<p>Jarrow looked at Locke and smiled.</p>

<p>"Northwest, five miles," called Jarrow, after a look
at the compass and the land.</p>

<p>"What course ye steerin'?"</p>

<p>"Nor'wes'bywes'."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Variation, one degree east," remarked Dinshaw,
and went back to his figuring, talking to himself and
scratching his head. From his conduct since sailing
it was obvious that he intended to hold himself aloof
from the rest of the party.</p>

<p>"Thinks he's navigatin'," whispered Jarrow, with a
wink to Trask.</p>

<p>"He looks a lot better than he did," said Locke.
"Has more colour and walks with more vigour."</p>

<p>"Good eatin'," said Jarrow. "He perked right up
the minute he come aboard. Acts like he's master.
Don't do no harm, only Mr. Peth gits rubbed the
wrong way sometimes. I say, if the old man gits any
fun out of thinkin' it's his own schooner, what's the
odds?"</p>

<p>"How did you come out on getting anything certain
about the position of his island?" asked Locke.
"From what you said last night it was a sure thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, we know where we're goin' right enough," said
Jarrow.</p>

<p>"Then he's given you some more data?"</p>

<p>"We ain't goin' on his say-so. He give me the leaf
out of his old log, with his noon position the day before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
he was lifted off his course by the typhoon."</p>

<p>"Is that enough?"</p>

<p>"We ought to run slap into his island. It's one of
the Capones, off the Zambales coast. There's a whole
flock of 'em, but the one I figure on stands out from the
rest, from what I've worked."</p>

<p>"Wilkins, at the hotel, was telling me the geodetic
people couldn't find the island."</p>

<p>"Wilkins?" Jarrow turned and looked at Locke intently.
"Oh, yes. Did he say anything about me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he spoke very highly of you."</p>

<p>"Well, it's this way," said Jarrow, after a thoughtful
pause. "The old man didn't give 'em the right
position. He said he'd piled up near one of the Sisters,
just to the south'ard of the Little Sister, to be exact.
But that's more'n sixty miles north of where the
<i>Wetherall</i> struck. Ye see, the old man didn't want
nobody to find the island if he couldn't go himself.
But he's all right now."</p>

<p>Peth came up the weather side of the poop, and seeing
the trio with the captain, turned abruptly to go
forward again.</p>

<p>"Did you want to see me, Mr. Peth?" called Jarrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The mate stopped, and pushing his cap to the back
of his head, grumbled an assent.</p>

<p>"What about?" asked Jarrow, leaning his elbows on
the top of the cabin trunk.</p>

<p>"I wanted to speak private," said Peth, grumblingly.</p>

<p>"Well, sing out," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"Thought I'd speak to ye about where I'd bunk,
sir," said Peth.</p>

<p>"Didn't we settle that?" demanded Jarrow, with
considerable surprise.</p>

<p>"Not to my tastes," said the mate.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"I thought I'd take my gear out, if it's all the same
to you, sir."</p>

<p>"Out where?"</p>

<p>"Out of that room, sir."</p>

<p>"Where'd ye want to bunk?"</p>

<p>"I thought I'd bunk for'ard. Bevins is with the
men&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you're the mate," said Jarrow. "Ye don't
want to be with the crew, do ye?"</p>

<p>"I thought mebbe if I moved for'ard I wouldn't be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
in the way."</p>

<p>"Nobody's said anything 'bout ye bein' in the way,"
said Jarrow, with rising temper.</p>

<p>"I'd be a heap more comfortable, sir," insisted
Peth.</p>

<p>"I won't be at all disturbed," said Trask, getting
out of his deck chair so that he could see Peth.</p>

<p>"I reckon I'd rather be for'ard," repeated the mate,
doggedly.</p>

<p>Captain Dinshaw came up through the companion,
and started toward Peth, glaring at the mate.</p>

<p>"What's this? What's this?" cried Dinshaw.</p>

<p>"Better keep quiet, sir, and let me handle it," said
Jarrow in a low tone. Then to Peth: "If ye think
ye'll be more comfortable for'ard, Peth, why, that's
your lookout. We'll let it stand that way till we talk
it over and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bad for discipline to have the mate for'ard with
the crew," shouted Dinshaw. "Ye'll stay with the
afterguard, Mr. Peth. I'm master here. That's all."</p>

<p>"Who is skipper, anyhow?" demanded Peth.</p>

<p>"I'm skipper," said Jarrow. "No use of gittin'
excited up this way. Captain Dinshaw, ye'll please<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
me if ye go below. Now we'll go for'ard and talk this
over, Mr. Peth. I won't have no disputin' aboard
me." He hurried after Peth, and they went forward
of the foremast, talking in low tones.</p>

<p>"Captain Dinshaw!" said Locke, as the old man
started to descend the stairs to the cabin.</p>

<p>"Dad!" warned Marjorie. "Don't hurt his feelings."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Dinshaw.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to go to your island?" asked
Locke, gently.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then we can't have this sort of thing, or I'll turn
back to Manila. Captain Jarrow is in command."</p>

<p>"I know now, sir," said Dinshaw, rubbing his forehead
with his hand, as if to brush away something
which affected his vision. "It's all clear in my head,
sir&mdash;I git kind o' dreamy, sir."</p>

<p>"All right," said Locke. "You'd better go down
and keep out of the sun. It's all right this time, but
you know we must not have a division of authority.
Captain Jarrow is master."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir." And Dinshaw, somewhat crestfallen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
went below.</p>

<p>"I merely wanted to take a hand in things," said
Locke. "Better for me to chip the old man and keep
him quiet than for Jarrow to give him fits."</p>

<p>"And I'm as well satisfied that Mr. Peth is going to
live in the forecastle, if that's a measure of his temper,"
said Trask, who was more annoyed by the mate's request
than he allowed the Lockes to see.</p>

<p>"I didn't like his looks from the first," said Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Oh, things'll get shaken down," said Locke. "But
I'll give Jarrow to understand that we don't want to
hear any more quarrels."</p>

<p>Trask and Marjorie left their chairs on the lee side of
the poop, and leaned against the rail, the better to see
what was taking place forward, where they could hear
Jarrow and Peth in quiet argument. From their
gestures it was plain that in spite of Jarrow's pleas
Peth was still obdurate.</p>

<p>Pennock, the man at the wheel, gave no sign that he
had heard any of the conversation aft, but stared over
the top of the cabin trunk, glancing aloft now and then
at the sails, and watching the compass. The crew
were busy wetting down the decks, having swept them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
after clearing a litter of rope and boxes.</p>

<p>Soon Captain Jarrow came back, looking red and
flustered, his cigar out and badly chewed. He made
an attempt to light it, but gave up the attempt and
threw it over the side.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to see this happen, Mr. Locke," said
Jarrow finally, as if he felt that he must say something
to restore a pleasant status.</p>

<p>"You know I've half a mind to put back to Manila
and throw him ashore," said Locke, severely. "We're
here for pleasure, Captain Jarrow, and we can't have
any such scenes. My daughter's worried."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr Peth's all right," said Jarrow. "His
bark's worse'n his bite. He feels a<!--**inserted missing a--> little awkward with
you folks aboard, that's all. It was the old man
scraped him."</p>

<p>"I've already chipped the old man about it," said
Locke. "I wish you'd let the matter drop. What
did Mr. Peth decide to do?"</p>

<p>"He's set on bunkin' with the men," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"All right, then, he can mess with the men," said
Locke. "We won't have him aft at all."</p>

<p>"All right," said Jarrow, and fell to pacing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
weather side of the poop, his hands clasped behind his
back.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Peth came clumping down the
waist and, calling two of the crew, went into the main
cabin. There was a banging of doors, heard above the
clatter of Shanghai Tom's chopping tray, and then
Peth went forward, carrying clothes under both arms,
followed by two men with his sea-chest.</p>

<p>The schooner was bowling along now at a good rate,
marching away from the land steadily, and making
little leeway. Trask went below, ostensibly to have
his bag unpacked, but really to have a talk with Doc
Bird. Also, he had an automatic pistol which he
thought he would get out and clean. He suspected
that it would do no harm to have it known that there
were weapons among the "passengers."</p>



<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Trask Has a Talk with Doc Bird</span></h2>


<p>Calling Doc Bird from the galley, Trask
set about putting his things in order in his
room, and sent the steward inside to open the
biggest bag, which was secured with straps.</p>

<p>"I reckon we better take this out, sir," suggested
Doc, as he made an effort to get the straps loose. He
found it hard to work in the narrow little room.</p>

<p>"No," said Trask, "open it in here." He stood in
the doorway, and let the door rest against his back,
holding it partly closed with one hand. It was his
purpose to keep Doc shut in, and so be able to question
him without being overheard.</p>

<p>"Mighty hard to open," said Doc, down on his
knees, struggling with the straps. It was hot in the
room, and rather dark, as the deadlight to the poop-deck
was fogged by sea water.</p>

<p>"You're new to the schooner, aren't you?" asked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Trask.</p>

<p>"Yassir. I jus' shipped fo' the roun' trip."</p>

<p>"How long have you known Mr. Peth?" Trask
kept his voice low, and bent down to Doc.</p>

<p>"Yassir. I know Mr. Peth. I know him fo' a long
time."</p>

<p>"Have you sailed with him before?"</p>

<p>"Yassir. I been along with Cap'n Jarrow an' Mr. Peth
off an' on six years. Got a key fo' this hyar satchel?"</p>

<p>"It isn't locked. Just press the lock to the left."</p>

<p>"You mighty ca'less with yo' possessions," said Doc
with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"What sort of a man is Mr. Peth?"</p>

<p>"Catch me with my stuff sailin' around loose. Some
o' these hyar native trash go'n walk off wid you, bag
an' baggage, if you don' watch out, man."</p>

<p>"Why do you suppose Mr. Peth wanted to move out
of here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's just kind o' techy."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Kind o' uppish. He don' git along wid nobody,
nohow, Mr. Peth don't."</p>

<p>"He's been with Captain Jarrow a long time, hasn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
he?"</p>

<p>Doc turned his head sidewise and looked at Trask,
and then looked out into the main cabin, as if to make
sure no one was listening before he went on.</p>

<p>"A lion an' a lamb," he said, in a scared whisper.</p>

<p>"And Peth's the lion?"</p>

<p>"Yassir, you got it. Peth, he'd fight with his own
gran'mother, that man. Argue en argue en argue.
He ain't fixin' to hurt nobody when he talks, but when
he stops talkin'&mdash;excuse me!"</p>

<p>"What does he do when he stops talking?"</p>

<p>"If ol' Doc Bird's on the lan'scape, he hunts a hole
an' he crawls in when Mr. Peth he begins to act up."</p>

<p>"You mean you're afraid of him?"</p>

<p>"Not exac'ly what you'd go an' call 'fraid, but I don'
take no chances." He chuckled again, and wagged his
head. He could not manipulate the lock to get the
bag open, and Trask reached down and showed him
how it was done.</p>

<p>"Then you consider Mr. Peth a dangerous man?"</p>

<p>"He sho' is."</p>

<p>"How is he dangerous?"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Trask, I don' lak' to go an' say nothin'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
agin a man, 'specially when he's matin' round a boat
what I'm in."</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose he's rough with a sailor if it suits his
fancy," said Trask, convinced now that Doc was
merely making talk, and telling a yarn simply to impress
him.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't look twice to hang somethin' on a
man's haid, Mr. Peth wouldn't. I done saw him stab
a man once, not no sailorman, neither, stab him right
in the back o' the neck with one o' these hyar Sweden
knives with a ring on the handle. He was a planter
down Zamboanga way, an' a genelman like you, in
white clothes. He come sassin' round Mr. Peth
on the pier. He won't sass 'round no mo', mos'
certain."</p>

<p>"Fol-de-rol," said Trask. "You're trying to make
him out a bad man. I want to know something about
him."</p>

<p>"Ain't I tellin' of ye?" asked Doc. "Who all can
tell ye, if I don'? Reckon that Zamboanga planter's
gwine come back to life jes' fo' talkin' purposes, Mr.
Trask?"</p>

<p>"But he and Captain Jarrow must get along if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
they've been together for several years."</p>

<p>"Git along, man! Them two don' git along, not the
way we-all say it. Mr. Peth an' de cap'n? Huh!
Them two git along smooth as a houn' dawg in a brier
patch."</p>

<p>"They quarrel a lot, eh?"</p>

<p>"Fight ain' no name fer it. Mr. Peth he owns part
of this hyar schooner, an' Cap'n Jarrow he wants fer to
git him out. I look for him to drap Mr. Peth over the
side some fine night&mdash;if Mr. Peth don' drap him fust."</p>

<p>"Then that's why Mr. Peth didn't want to sleep
aft here?"</p>

<p>"Mos' doubtless. He pick up his traps an' go.
Mr. Peth he done ship de crew. Yo' don' reckon he
picked out Cap'n Jarrow's Sunday friends, does ye?
No, suh. Mr. Peth, he knows what he's a-doin' of. He
looks to be with his own friends when he goes for'ard."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a nice arrangement, to have the mate
in with the crew and opposed to the captain."</p>

<p>"Won't do no harm thataway," said Doc with much
assurance.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I reckon Cap'n Jarrow's got some friends along."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose you side with the captain, eh?"</p>

<p>"I mos' certain do. Old Doc Bird knows whar his
bread is buttered, an' he keeps right close alongside de
skipper."</p>

<p>"Mr. Peth knows that?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Peth never gits no chance to fergit it. An'
the cook, he ain' got no use fo' Mr. Peth."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"He better not go argufyin' with Shanghai Tom."</p>

<p>"Why not? What could the cook do?"</p>

<p>"Do?" Doc looked up and rolled his eyes, listened
a second to make sure the cook was busy in the galley,
and then went on: "Do? He'd let a meat axe in
him. Yo' jes' want to stand clear if yo' see Mr. Peth
an' Tom lookin' crossways at each other. My goodness,
Mr. Trask, yo' sho' got a powerful lot of stuff in
this grip-sack!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's tightly packed. Take the stuff out and
put it in the upper bunk. I'll use the lower. So Peth
and Jarrow fight. Do you mean to tell me there's
always fighting? That it amounts to anything more
than arguments?"</p>

<p>"Fight! Lord-amighty! Them two! They'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
rather fight en a yaller dawg likes fo' to worry a hambone.
Not out an' out strakin', but jes' kind o' pickin'
en a pickin'; insultin' like. But Mr. Peth he's makin'
to do somebody hurt some time."</p>

<p>"Let 'em fight," said Trask, and he began to help
Doc hand out the clothing from the bag which the
steward stowed above. When the bag was partly
empty Trask opened a leather pocket that was fitted
to one of the compartments. He gave an exclamation
of surprise as he found it empty. It was in this pocket
that his automatic revolver was ordinarily carried.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Doc.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. I've misplaced something, that's
all."</p>

<p>"Yo' don' reckon Mr. Locke'll go an' git skeered
'count o' Mr. Peth's carryin' on, does ye?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe anybody in this party is very
scared of Mr. Peth."</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Locke, she's a powerful nice lady. I
knows quality folks the minute I comes across 'em.
Now yo', Mr. Trask, is all off yo' cou'se."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yo' all ain' no business fo' mixin' in with a ship full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
o' low-down rakin's an' scrapin's like we got aboard
hyar."</p>

<p>"You mean Captain Jarrow and Mr. Peth?"</p>

<p>"Crew," said Doc.</p>

<p>"What about the crew?"</p>

<p>"Bad lot."</p>

<p>"You mean the crew can't be trusted?"</p>

<p>"Honest enough, sho'ly, but they ain't in yo' all's
set. Now I know quality folks, an' when I sot eyes on
yo' all, I like fo' to throwed a fit. Huh! 'Ristocrats
ain' no business hoppin' along in a boat like this. I go
fo' to know 'ristocrats when I sees 'em. I was a pantry
man in a Suezer."</p>

<p>"But this isn't any tea-party to which the crew are
invited."</p>

<p>"Huh! Don' yo' go fo' to fool yo' self."</p>

<p>"Oh, fiddlesticks!" said Trask. "What are you
trying to do? Make me afraid of everybody in the
schooner?"</p>

<p>Doc scratched his woolly head and rolled his eyes.</p>

<p>"I ain't got nothin' mo' fo' to say," he declared,
with an air of mystery.</p>

<p>Doc was getting a trifle too chummy to suit Trask,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and he thought it high time to bring the discussion to a
close. While he felt Doc might be valuable as a
friend and an ally, the garrulous steward might prove
to be dangerous as a gossip. Trask feared that he had
made a mistake by discussing the ship's affairs with
him, so he gave the black man a generous tip and
dismissed him with a caution against repeating anything
that had been said.</p>

<p>"If yo' go to need any advice, Mr. Trask, jes' yo'
call on me," he whispered as he went out. "I don't
let nothin' what might come in handy slip by me."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Trask, who realized that this was a
direct offer to turn spy against Captain Jarrow and
Peth. He did not care to enter into any sort of an
arrangement yet felt that it would be wise to retain
friendly relations with the steward.</p>

<p>"If I pick up anything, Mr. Trask, I'll put a bug in
yo' ear."</p>

<p>"All right," said Trask. "But I don't favour your
spying on anybody for my sake. You're merely to
let me know in case anything goes on that I should
know, which relates to the safety of all hands."</p>

<p>"Oh, I ain' go'n to do no snoopin'," said Doc, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
one of his peculiar chuckles. "But I looks fer
carryin's on."</p>

<p>"I don't want you gossiping," said Trask. Doc
was promising to become something of a nuisance.</p>

<p>"Yassir," said the steward, and went away to the
galley.</p>

<p>Trask now gave his complete attention to emptying
the bag which should have contained the
pistol. He made a careful search. But the pistol
was gone and he was sure he had packed it that
morning at the hotel, together with two boxes of
ammunition.</p>

<p>So he ransacked every possible place where the
pistol could be misplaced among his effects. But
after going through two smaller bags, and shaking out
every bit of clothing, even to folding up the sheets and
blankets on both bunks, he was sure the pistol was
gone.</p>

<p>So far as Trask knew, the only person besides Doc
Bird to cross the threshold of his room was Peth. But
the mate had been there only a few minutes. Whoever
the thief was, he apparently had gone through the
bag looking for arms, for nothing else had been disturbed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
And it must have taken some time to open
the straps and put them back in place, for the leather
was stiff and the buckles difficult to manage. Trask
had found the ends of the straps tucked in under the
leather bands, just as he had fixed them himself at the
hotel.</p>

<p>Besides, to get the pistol and ammunition the
leather pocket had to be opened, and Trask had found
the flap back in place and buckled down. Likewise,
the bag had been opened before his own eyes by Doc
Bird, and he had stood over the steward while it was
unpacked.</p>

<p>Doc couldn't have known the pistol was there, for
immediately the bag was opened he stood up and let
Trask pass out the contents. Peth had been in the
room probably fifteen minutes, and part of that time
two of the crew were with him.</p>

<p>Trask knew it would be unfair to charge Peth with
the theft of the pistol, or to question the mate about
it, and to report his loss to Jarrow might precipitate
more trouble on top of the ill-feeling which had already
cropped out aboard the schooner.</p>

<p>So he decided to wait and take the matter up at a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
time more convenient for an investigation.</p>

<p>Trask left his room and went out on deck as if nothing
had happened to arouse his suspicions against anybody
in the vessel. But he had an idea that Peth
might know what had become of the automatic pistol.</p>



<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">How the Schooner Arrived off the Island</span></h2>


<p>Trask found Captain Jarrow pacing the
weather side of the poop-deck when he went
up. The captain seemed to be in ill-humour,
as if his tilt with Peth had not been settled to his liking,
and his attitude that of shame for having lost his face
so soon with his "passengers."</p>

<p>He nodded pleasantly to Trask, who observed that his
bronzed face appeared flushed with anger. There was a
savage glint in his eye in spite of his silent geniality.</p>

<p>Trask leaned against the taffrail, waiting to see if
Jarrow would speak, and if the captain's mood
warranted it, intended to report the loss of his pistol.</p>

<p>Locke and Marjorie were in deck chairs around the
cabin on the lee side, sheltered from sun and wind to
some degree by the sail over their heads.</p>

<p>But Jarrow said nothing, continuing to pace from
the break of the poop and aft, ignoring Trask, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
keeping a watchful eye on the man at the helm and the
sails. His manner indicated that he did not wish to
engage in conversation, but preferred to consider
matters which required careful thought.</p>

<p>Dinshaw was standing at the port bulwark abreast
of the mainmast, gazing out over the sea in a reflective
way, and looking quite forlorn and chastened. The
crew, in skylarking style, were drawing water over the
side with buckets and throwing it down the deck from
forward, so that Dinshaw frequently had to pull himself
up on the bulwark to avoid having his feet wet.</p>

<p>This gaiety forward was in striking contrast to the
sense of gloom which had come over the after part of
the schooner. Not that any one was suffering any discomforts
from the fact that Jarrow had clashed with
the mate, unless it were Jarrow himself, but Peth's
irascibility had checked the holiday air with which the
schooner's company had put to sea. But the crew had
suddenly become gleeful, as if the quarrel between
master and mate had provided a great joke.</p>

<p>Peth was walking about forward, in bare feet, growling
out a word now and then, and obviously going to
great pains not to look aft. When his back was turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
from them the sailors indulged in grins and back-slappings
and other rough demonstrations of their
knowledge that the "afterguard" were not on agreeable
terms.</p>

<p>This prankish mood of the crew was shown in their
efforts to make Dinshaw uncomfortable. It was plain
to Trask that they wanted to arouse the old man's ire,
or pick on him in a sneaking way, to let him know that
he had lost his previous standing with them. It was
all undoubtedly meant to have petty revenge on him
for the way he had been lording it about before Peth
had quarrelled with Jarrow. They seemed to have an
idea that because Peth had come forward, they could
show the old captain disrespect.</p>

<p>In a way it was all harmless enough, yet Trask felt
that neither Peth nor Jarrow should allow such lax
discipline. Dinshaw belonged aft, and for that reason
to treat him with contumely was a reflection on everybody
aft. But Trask thought that it was no time to
call the captain's attention to what was going on,
partly because Dinshaw should have remained aft
while such work was being done, and partly because a
criticism from Jarrow would undoubtedly cause a renewal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of the row that should be allowed to blow over.</p>

<p>The crew's jeering attitude was soon brought out in
another manner while Trask remained near the captain.
Doc Bird went to the lee side to throw over
some refuse from the galley, and before he could make
his escape back to the galley one of the men, whom
Trask knew to be Shope, hurled a bucket of water in
such fashion that Doc's legs were wet.</p>

<p>The steward said something which Trask did not
understand, but which must have been suitable to the
occasion, for Shope took anger at once, and advanced
on the negro threateningly. But Doc ran back to the
galley, and his voice, raised in remonstrance, could be
heard as he expressed opinions to Shanghai Tom about
Shope.</p>

<p>If there had been no trouble in the schooner Trask
would have thought nothing of the incident, and might
have enjoyed it as a harmless joke. But he saw that
the crew seemed to be openly antagonistic to all hands
aft, for the others joined in open laughter at the discomfiture
of the steward. And what was more significant,
Peth and Jarrow saw what happened, but
both ignored it. The crew were evidently taking advantage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of the relations between master and mate, and
seemed bent on stirring up fresh discord.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Jarrow went below, without looking
at Trask, and from the set of his jaw Trask knew
that his anger was growing. Presently he heard Jarrow
talking in a gruff way to Doc Bird, and the latter's
whining and conciliatory voice in argument.</p>

<p>"I don't want no back slack from the likes o' you,"
Jarrow said, and Doc subsided.</p>

<p>Trask went around to where Locke and Marjorie
were sitting, and with his back against the side of the
cabin trunk, sat and chatted.</p>

<p>At lunch time Captain Jarrow joined them at table,
and made special efforts to renew the good-fellowship
of the schooner, chiefly by a careful avoidance of any
mention of Peth. He made jokes and told stories and
except for a wicked look now and then at Doc Bird,
was very jolly and agreeable, so that he made a decidedly
good impression on Locke and Marjorie. But
Trask had some doubts of his natural affability and
was inclined toward the belief that Jarrow was hardly
so angelic as he painted himself.</p>

<p>Dinshaw did not appear at table. On investigation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
it was found that the old man was in the waist boat
taking a nap and he was not disturbed.</p>

<p>Peth came aft shortly, and while Marjorie, Trask,
and Locke played cards at the cabin table, Jarrow and
the mate had a long, low-toned conference, which
ended by Jarrow's coming down and going to his
room.</p>

<p>"Everything's all right," he said to Locke, with a
vigorous wink, and pointed up the companion with
his thumb.</p>

<p>"You mean he comes back?" asked Locke.</p>

<p>"No, sir, he stays for'ard, but it's all smoothed out.
He ain't a bad sort when ye rub him the right way,"
and thereupon disappeared for his afternoon sleep.</p>

<p>When the card party broke up, and the trio went to
the poop-deck, Peth was all smiles, and arranged their
chairs on the starboard side. But Locke practically
ignored him, except to be officially pleasant, as it had
been agreed that unless the mate asked permission to
come aft again his status should be exactly like that of
the crew. So far as Trask could judge, Peth seemed
perfectly agreeable to that arrangement, and once he
had given formal assistance, went back to the weather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
side, and kept to himself.</p>

<p>Dinshaw crawled out from his nook in the waist
boat, rubbed his eyes, and looked about him in a dazed
sort of way, and then went into the cabin to wheedle
Doc Bird out of a meal after which he hid himself away
in his room and remained there until dinner.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jarrow, as he watched Doc Bird light
the cabin lamp. "We ought to raise the island some
time before noon if this breeze holds."</p>

<p>"Good enough," said Locke. "But I can't say I'm
in any particular hurry to get anywhere. I've had
the best rest and loaf to-day I've had in a long time."</p>

<p>"We've certainly walked along," said Trask.</p>

<p>"Oh, the old gal can go," said Jarrow, proudly.
"Mr. Peth has kept her diggin' along. We've logged
near ten knots steady. I never looked to march like
we have. If we keep it up through the night, we ought
to have supper the next time at anchor."</p>

<p>"Then Captain Dinshaw and I'll be able to start our
prospecting early," said Trask, with a nod at the old
captain.</p>

<p>"I can take ye right to the place," said Dinshaw,
eagerly. "Ye won't have no trouble to find gold with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
me along."</p>

<p>"You people better draw up an agreement as to
who's to have all this gold," said Locke, with a waggish
smile. "Suppose we fill this schooner up with yellow
stuff? Who owns it?"</p>

<p>"Share and share alike," suggested Dinshaw. "I'll
make ye all rich."</p>

<p>"You mean me and all hands?" asked Jarrow.
Trask looked to Dinshaw for a reply, a trifle surprised
at Jarrow's question, for of course the schooner's crew
could claim no share of anything, as Jarrow was being
paid for his part in the expedition and was taking no
chances of being out of pocket if the island proved to
be a fiasco.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Dinshaw, a little ruffled. "What's
you and all hands got to do with this v'yage, outside of
doin' yer duty?"</p>

<p>"Can't ye take a little joke?" demanded Jarrow,
with a wry grin. "Think we're goin' to run away with
yer island?"</p>

<p>Dinshaw became confused at this, and stared at the
others helplessly. Marjorie spoke up and reassured
the old man that no one wanted to cheat him out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
what was his, and he went on eating, content.</p>

<p>But Jarrow's sharpness put an end to the pleasant
relations which had been resumed. In a few minutes
he found an excuse to leave the table and did not come
back.</p>

<p>"We certainly have joined a happy family," said
Locke. "If it wasn't that we were so near to this
island, I'd be for turning the schooner around
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Dad!" said Marjorie. "Don't take it so
seriously! I want to see the island."</p>

<p>"So do I, but I hate to hear everybody aboard
barking at everybody else. First it's Mr. Peth, and
now the captain's on his high horse. They're not
being paid to perform like a box of wild-cats, and I'll
inform Captain Jarrow to that effect before long if
things don't change."</p>

<p>"He wants to steal my island!" whispered Dinshaw.</p>

<p>Doc Bird, who was serving the coffee, started visibly,
and looked at Dinshaw in amazement.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Locke, and Trask and Marjorie
turned to the old captain.</p>

<p>"Jarrow and Peth want to steal my island and have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
all the gold," insisted Dinshaw, his face tragic.</p>

<p>"Steward, give my compliments to Captain Jarrow
and tell him I'd speak to him," said Locke.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't do that," cautioned Trask. "Let's see
what this is about. I don't think it's wise to jump
at conclusions. What makes you think they're going
to steal your island?"</p>

<p>"Call the cap'n, sir?" asked Doc, on his way to the
companion.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Locke.</p>

<p>"What reason have you for believing that Jarrow
and Peth want to steal your gold, captain?" asked
Trask, gently.</p>

<p>"I know," said Dinshaw, wagging his head.</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I dreamed it. I was asleep out there in the
long boat and heard 'em talking."</p>

<p>"We can't very well blame Jarrow for what you
dream," said Locke, relieved that there was nothing
more substantial to Dinshaw's charges than a dream.</p>

<p>"I didn't dream it," said Dinshaw, with sudden
conviction. "I heard 'em talk. Jarrow said if there
was gold on the island, he and Peth was to have it for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
themselves."</p>

<p>Doc chuckled, and showed his teeth in a broad smile,
with a sly wink at Trask.</p>

<p>"He talks in his sleep," whispered Doc into Trask's
ear, as he bent over to remove a plate.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry," said Locke. "Nobody's going
to cheat you, and I'm here to see that they don't.
But I'd keep quiet about my dreams, if I wanted to go
on to the island, or we'll be back in Manila in three
shakes of a lamb's tail."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir," said Dinshaw.</p>

<p>Trask was between two minds to tell Locke that his
pistol had been stolen, for while he placed little credence
in what Dinshaw had said, he began to wonder
if there wasn't something going on aboard the schooner
that promised trouble. What if Dinshaw had not
been dreaming after all? Suppose Peth and Jarrow
were plotting to play all hands double?</p>

<p>But it would be silly to abandon the voyage just as
they were about to arrive at the island, and while
undoubtedly there had been gossip and conjecture
about the island, it was quite possible that if Dinshaw
had overheard some light talk, he had misinterpreted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
its import.</p>

<p>Trask knew that Locke's attitude was now such
that if he reported the theft of the pistol, Locke would
decline to go forward another mile, an idea which
Trask could not bring himself to consider for various
reasons, the most important being that he did not
want to say farewell to Marjorie Locke and see her
sail away to the United States.</p>

<p>And as there being any actual danger from Jarrow
and Peth, other than such as might result from a
serious quarrel between the two, he considered a piece
of absurdity.</p>

<p>As Trask thought the thing over later in the evening,
however, he realized that his own deductions and
desires were selfish, and that after all he could not
assume the entire responsibility for Marjorie's safety.
He knew it was only fair to take Locke into his confidence
regarding what had happened.</p>

<p>So, getting Locke below in the cabin while the
others were on deck, Trask told Locke that his pistol
was missing. But Locke treated the matter lightly,
and said he did not believe it could have any significance.
It was his opinion that the weapon had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
stolen by some of the crew, and he rather suspected
Doc Bird. He said he would speak to the captain
about it after they arrived at the island, and that the
steward's quarters should be searched and Doc
questioned, but he doubted the advisability of making
what he called a rumpus about it now, especially as
Marjorie might be worried and he wanted her to get a
good night's sleep.</p>

<p>Trask let the business rest there and went up with
Locke again to enjoy the brilliant moonlight and
listen to the impromptu concert which the crew had
begun with a mouth organ and a flute.</p>

<p>Even Peth joined in the fun, and unbent to the
extent of whistling some popular airs of the sad and
sentimental variety with many trills and flourishes.</p>

<p>Doc's part in the evening's entertainment was a
buck-and-wing dance of a most violent sort, and when
he had finished, Jarrow told him to serve all hands with
a tot of rum.</p>

<p>Everybody went to bed in the best of spirits, and for
the first time since leaving Manila it appeared that the
whole ship's company was contented.</p>

<p>Trask left his room door open, and was awakened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
several times during the night. It seemed to him that
the wind had shifted, and that there was much tacking,
for all night there was running about on deck, and
thumping of blocks. At least a dozen times he heard
Jarrow bawling to "Go about," and Peth's voice from
the bows yelling "Hard alee," and the jibs being
handled to the accompaniment of shivering sails and
the lurch of the schooner as she stood on a new board.</p>

<p>All aft slept late, and were not about for breakfast
until well past eight o'clock, when they found Doc
Bird grinning like an ebony monkey.</p>

<p>"What the devil was all the stock-yards noise about
last night?" demanded Locke, as he came out of his
room and went to the door to look forward, searching
the horizon ahead.</p>

<p>"Shorely broke my bones, sir," said Doc. "We been
a sawin' up an' down all night, but the old man he kep'
on his close spite o' wind an' high water."</p>

<p>"I thought we were turning over several times,"
said Marjorie, as she took her place at table.</p>

<p>"Blowed lak' she never blowed befo'," opined Doc.
"But we done come home."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Locke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Didn' yo' see the islan'?"</p>

<p>There was an exodus to the deck at this, but although
the trio searched the rim of the sky they could
not make out a sign of land. The schooner was sailing
close into the wind, which had abated into a steady
though stiff breeze, and she was pitching over the
swells with an even, rocking movement.</p>

<p>Doc grinned and pointed over the port bow, and
Jarrow came down from the poop, smiling proudly.</p>

<p>"There's our island," he said.</p>

<p>Trask managed to pick it up, but the others could
not see it, and went back to breakfast. Trask soon
followed, observing that Shope was in the fore crosstrees
studying the distant speck with a glass.</p>

<p>"We ought to be up to it by night," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"Night!" said Trask, surprised.</p>

<p>"Perhaps before dark," said Jarrow, a trifle disconcerted
at Trask's manner. "I don't look to hold
this wind all day."</p>

<p>"But we seem to be making good time," said Trask.</p>

<p>"Not so good as ye'd think," replied Jarrow. "She's
kickin' up her heels and makin' a great fuss about it,
maybe six knots now, and enough leeway to choke an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
ox."</p>

<p>With that he went up and in a few minutes put the
schooner on the other tack, but this time she was not
sailing into the wind nearly so closely as she had been,
and was now headed so that if she held her course, she
would clear the island by several miles and leave it to
starboard.</p>

<p>Trask said nothing, but suspected that Jarrow was
killing time, especially as the schooner did not go about
for a couple of hours, and then on such a sharp angle
with her former course that but few miles were gained
in approaching the island.</p>

<p>Dinshaw spent the morning pottering over a chart
in great excitement, and his manner indicated that he
wanted to be left to himself.</p>

<p>All day they tacked up and down, Jarrow explaining
that there might be reefs about, although there wasn't
a spot of broken water in sight even with the heavy sea
that was running after the night's blow.</p>

<p>At one time Trask thought the delay in getting on
was due to Peth, for the mate was most deliberate in
going about, and it was half an hour after the order had
been given to put the schooner on a new tack before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Peth got down his jib and shouted for a lee helm.</p>

<p>It was near sundown before they had the island
within three miles, whereupon Jarrow so man&#339;uvred
that they ran straight in for it, and came to anchor in
its lee, behind a reef which ran to the south of and
almost parallel with it.</p>

<p>By this time it was apparent to all that the island
was the one they were seeking. It stood up out of the
sea, green and fresh, except for the single peak, which
was dun brown.</p>

<p>Dinshaw declared that this was it, and pointed out
the reef which he had painted into his picture, which
showed like a white ridge over the greenish water.</p>

<p>"It was here the <i>Wetherall</i> struck," he said.</p>

<p>"But the four palm trees, and the big rock," said
Trask; "I don't see them."</p>

<p>"Ah ha!" said Dinshaw, slyly. "I put them in to
fool folks. There ain't no palm trees like them I
painted."</p>

<p>Jarrow looked disgustedly at him, and gave orders
to Peth to have the dinghy lowered.</p>

<p>"Are we going ashore now?" asked Marjorie.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," said Jarrow. "We can't trust the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
weather in a hole like this. May have to wear and git
out. All hands stick close aboard to-night."</p>

<p>"In the morning," said Trask.</p>

<p>"In the mornin," echoed Dinshaw, but he seemed
disappointed and scarcely able to wait for the time of
going ashore.</p>

<p>Trask got out his prospecting bag, and after supper
they all sat on the poop and talked and joked about
what was in store for them the next day&mdash;all except
Dinshaw, who, like a child, had gone to bed early, that
morning would come the quicker.</p>

<p>Then Jarrow followed suit. Locke, Trask, and
Marjorie remained for an hour's chat in the darkness
after which Trask was left to himself to finish his cigar.</p>

<p>"Good luck, Mr. Trask," Marjorie had whispered,
as she went down the companion, and he touched her
hand playfully.</p>

<p>He remained in his deck chair for some time, with
only the friendly glow of his cigar to keep him company,
wondering how it would all end. For all his impatience
to get to the island, now that it was lying
there within stone's throw behind the whisper of the
waves washing its beach, he was sorry they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
arrived so soon. For if there should be no gold on
the island, it would be a case of turning back, and a
couple of days more would see them in Manila, and
Marjorie Locke homeward bound with her father.
But if there should be gold! Well, that might give
this voyage a new aspect, it might alter his own fortunes
in such way that he could tell Marjorie Locke
that he loved her.</p>

<p>Of course, if Dinshaw's discovery proved to be only
a pocket, or no gold at all, that would put an end to
things. But if there was gold in quantities that would
pay for mining it, his own share might be a good stake
in life. His future hung on the old man's story, that
is his future considered with Marjorie Locke, and
Trask had now come to the point of not being able to
consider his own future alone, although he did not
realize that wholly. It was a thought he kept in the
back of his mind for fear it might turn out to be only a
dream.</p>

<p>He threw his cigar into the sea, and stood up
suddenly. There was a queer noise from the break of
the poop. It sounded as if someone who had been
startled had fled. He did not move for several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
minutes. Then it came back to him that there were
other things to consider besides the success of this
venture in gold and his future with Marjorie Locke.</p>

<p>The schooner was quiet, ominously quiet. The
queer noise had jarred his nerves, and now he began to
wonder if there was not some menace about the decks.</p>

<p>He heard the main shrouds creak as if someone
were going aloft and then a rustle like a whispered
caution.</p>

<p>Without a warning, he turned and stepped abruptly
into the shaft of light which came up through the
companion, and went below to his room, where he shut
himself in.</p>

<p>Whatever he did, he knew it would have to be
carried on with all caution. He would have to meet
sneaking and spying with the same tactics, but he was
determined to keep watch throughout the night.</p>



<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Trask Undertakes a Private Investigation</span></h2>


<p>Trask was more worried than he liked to admit,
even to himself. While he had nothing
tangible in the way of suspicion, he disliked
the manner in which events had shaped themselves,
or had been shaped by Jarrow.</p>

<p>From the time they had raised the island, Trask had
seen on the part of Jarrow a decided reluctance to
arrive at anchorage before dark. There was no doubt
about it. He had allowed the schooner to lag when
she could have been driven ahead. Whether this was
due to Jarrow's deliberate contrivance, or was the result
of a tacit acceptance of Peth's dilatory ways in
seamanship, Trask had no means of determining with
accuracy. He could only draw conclusions.</p>

<p>It might have been that Jarrow was willing to overlook
Peth's delays in order to avoid bringing on a new
argument with the mate. And Jarrow might have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
been wise to avoid a resumption of trouble, for, as Peth
had been openly insolent and had carried a chip on his
shoulder all the way from Manila, it was just as well
that the captain did not give him the satisfaction of
a row.</p>

<p>But Trask blamed Jarrow for being too complacent
in small things, which had encouraged Peth to insubordination.
It would have been far better if the
mate had been brought into place with a sharp and
short encounter which would determine just who was
master, than to continue strained relations which only
allowed Peth to smoulder and feed his rising anger with
growls and grumbles in the hearing of the crew.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that Jarrow was trying to
smooth things out and avoid a direct clash. He
dreaded unpleasantness in the presence of Locke. But
to Trask the obvious delay in coming up to the island
was only a small part of his growing fears that the
situation aboard the schooner was worse than a mere
temporary ill-feeling between the captain and the
mate.</p>

<p>A decided change had come over the crew. They
were strangely quiet, and when Trask or Locke or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Marjorie came in sight, the men were full of covert
looks and signals to each other with their hands for
caution and whispers.</p>

<p>There was a feeling of tension, a sudden stiffening
of demeanour once the anchor was down. It was not
so much expressed as shown by repression. There
was a soberness of purpose in the most trifling details
of their duties, as if a crisis long expected had arrived.</p>

<p>This change in manner was best exemplified by Doc
Bird. Trask had noticed that when serving the table
he had a way of looking over his shoulder suddenly, or
taking on a look of scared intentness at any unexpected
sounds from the deck or in the cabin. Doc had become
strangely alert, watchful of everybody, and
nervous to the point of sudden shivering attacks.
Trask ascribed Doc's actions to an unexplained coolness
which had sprung up between the steward and
Shanghai Tom, although it was quite possible Doc was
aware of something of the nature which had given
Trask a sense of disquiet, this undercurrent of insincerity,
of hidden meanings, of an evil spirit lurking
under the friendly relations of Jarrow and Dinshaw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
with the trio who had come seeking the island.</p>

<p>Considering these matters, Trask undressed and put
on his pajamas. Then he opened the door of his room,
and rolled into his bunk, purposely accentuating the
creaking of the boards under his mattress so that any
listener might be assured he had turned in for the
night.</p>

<p>The hole cut in the upper part of Jarrow's door was
open and dark. The captain, to all appearances, had
gone to sleep, but Trask had plans for the night and
did not care to take chances at having them upset.</p>

<p>There was a mild snoring from Dinshaw's room and
despite the chafing of the schooner's gear and the
patter of the water under her counter, she seemed
deathly quiet after the interminable groaning of her
timbers during the passage from Manila.</p>

<p>The swinging lamp over the cabin table was burning
dimly, waves of its light washing into Trask's room
like the lifting of a lazy tide, and whirling grotesque
shadows up and down the bulkhead.</p>

<p>The lighted lamp stood in the way of Trask's carrying
out his plan. He wished he had found some excuse
for putting it out earlier. But he had not realized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
that it was to be left burning. He wanted to go
out and do a little reconnoitering, but as the door of
the main cabin leading forward was open, he had no
way of leaving the cabin without being seen from the
forecastle.</p>

<p>It was from the forecastle that he hoped to get some
inkling of how the crew was getting on. Immediately
after the anchor was down Trask observed that the
crew had gone below, and, except for an occasional
gruff call, or a joking sally, nothing had been seen or
heard from them.</p>

<p>Trask was confident they had not turned in to sleep.
There had been sounds of rough gaiety, promptly
subdued, and a few bars of music on a mouth organ,
checked abruptly. The scuttle had been closed, and
Trask thought it queer that there should be a desire
to shut themselves up, for while the evening was cool
enough in the open, the temperature arose in a stifling
way at any shutting off of the air currents.</p>

<p>Trask would have thought nothing of it if the crew
had openly quarrelled, or engaged in skylarking, or had
sat around and smoked and chatted quietly. But
they appeared ominously furtive. And Trask knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
that if there was anything sinister behind their skulking,
Peth must have a hand in whatever was going on.</p>

<p>The lamp must be disposed of in a manner not to
attract the attention of either the crew or those aft.
He first thought of calling softly to Doc Bird and asking
him to put out the light. But if Doc demurred, or
declared that the light could not be extinguished except
by order of Jarrow, Trask would have called attention
to his own wishes and his plan would be balked.</p>

<p>Besides, Doc would undoubtedly want to talk, and
Jarrow would thereby be disturbed and become watchful,
and all hands aft be roused. If the light were put
out at Trask's request, and later he was found prowling
on deck, he could no longer maintain his character of
being a person without suspicion of anything amiss
aboard.</p>

<p>But if he put the light out himself, he could offer the
plea that it prevented him from sleeping, and the same
excuse could be given if he were later found outside for
a little fresh air. If any of the crew did resent his
presence forward, he would have proof that they were
wary of being spied upon. That, if nothing more,
would indicate to him that his suspicions were well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
founded.</p>

<p>He got out of his bunk with great care and struck a
match. Then he stepped boldly into the cabin and
turned down the lamp until the wick snuffed out the
flame. With the match still burning in his hand, he
went back to his room, thus establishing for any
watcher the fact that he had returned to bed after the
lamp was extinguished.</p>

<p>Waiting a while to make sure there would be no investigation
as to why the light went out, he crawled
out over the coaming of the door of his room. It was
necessary that he keep low, for he was not sure whether
there was one of the crew on watch aft. To any one
looking through the cabin from the companionway
Trask would be visible against the lantern hanging
from a forestay if he walked erect in crossing the
cabin.</p>

<p>Gaining the outer deck, he stood clear of the doorway
and hugged the forward bulkhead of the cabin
trunk, taking care not to mask the forward port-hole of
the galley with his back. If Doc Bird had heard him
crawling out, he might be of an inquiring turn of mind,
in his present panicky condition, and explore with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
knife through the open port.</p>

<p>Trask had in the jacket pocket of his pajamas
matches and cigarettes, so that in case he were
challenged he could assume a careless manner by preparing
to have a smoke, and at the same time illuminate
the face of any one he encountered.</p>

<p>He moved forward along the starboard bulwark,
feeling his way with his bare feet, taking great pains
not to stumble over any obstacle. He could make out
the loom of the island over the starboard quarter, a
black spot focussed in the all-pervading blackness of
the night. Everything seemed to give promise of
secrecy for him. The rasp of the boom-jaws, the
swishing of coiled ropes on the pin-rails, and the chirping
creak of the shrouds as the schooner bobbed and
rolled on the lulling swells, concealed the slight sounds
of his advance.</p>

<p>He stopped and looked aft every few steps, listening
for noises in the cabin. He could see the faint outline
of the mizzen boom and the upper edge of the cabin.
His eyes, better adjusted now to the gloom, saw a black
shape over the cabin roof. It startled him for a
second, for he thought it might be Jarrow peering toward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
him, until he knew it for a roll of canvas which
had been left there to spread as awning.</p>

<p>He went on, stopping when he felt the well of the
deck rise as he approached the forecastle. Presently
he saw a tiny point of light flare up and die away.
Then he caught the spicy aroma of a native cigarette
in the soft air charged with the acrid smell of new
hemp, the resinous odour of the deck seams, the sweet
reek of opium smoked by forgotten crews and the
earthy flavour of the jungles close at hand.</p>

<p>The thought came to him that perhaps it was he
who was exotic in the schooner. It might be for this
reason that he was too ready to mistake normal things
as evidences of a menace which did not exist. He
wondered if this fact might not well account for the
formless fears he had felt about Peth and the crew.
Like a person who wakes in the night, to find the
windows where they shouldn't be, his judgment, too,
might be at fault, and affairs far better than he thought
them.</p>

<p>Trask had no worries for himself. The pursuit of
gold in untrammelled parts of the world was his business,
and at times danger was but the thrill which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
went with the game. He knew that if he were the
only passenger in the schooner he would very likely
be in his bunk asleep instead of hunting trouble.</p>

<p>But he felt a responsibility. This wild project of
taking a young woman in a schooner, with a crew of
men who had all the outer aspects of rascals, and a
mild madman, to hunt an island, was largely his own
fault and Trask now realized it.</p>

<p>Locke was far too credulous, or rather incredulous.
Like most Americans who have lived quiet lives and
attended to their own business, he lacked imagination
for dangerous possibilities in the motives of others.
Such adventures as he had had were out of books,
and he had taken it for granted that what he read was
always improbable and impossible. Such people
never believe in danger until they have a revolver
thrust into their faces. And Locke had come aboard
the schooner with a roll of yellow-backed bills so big
that he could hold in his hand more wealth than all
the ship's company together could earn in a year of
honest labour.</p>

<p>Trask almost wished he had declined to go in with
Locke on the trip to the island. He had been quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
too easy-going about it all himself, neglecting to take
precautions about Jarrow and the crew because he had
been reluctant to forego the pleasure of Miss Marjorie's
company. Trask had been exiled so long in far corners
of the globe that he was strongly averse to giving
up a single hour to business details which he might
have with the American girl.</p>

<p>Then he knew that to tell Locke he did not care to go
to the island and later to go by himself would have
been sneakingly selfish. Now that they were embarked
on the venture, he felt that he must do all he possibly
could for the protection of his companions. He
wished that he had demanded an investigation when
he found his pistol missing. He moved forward with
careful steps, knowing that there must be a man sitting
on the forecastle head facing toward him, else he could
not have seen the light from the cigarette.</p>

<p>The foremast and the boom were faintly visible in
relief against the lighter shade of the sky, and knowing
he might be seen above the bulwark, Trask moved
away from the edge of the schooner, and drew near the
base of the foremast, which offered better concealment.
He was now but a few feet from the forecastle scuttle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and could see it outlined by a dim pencilling of light.
Voices reached him, but he was not able to distinguish
any words.</p>

<p>Presently he heard wary footsteps ahead, and saw
a figure rise up and go into the bows, marked by a
faint, comet-like streak of light which must be the
man's cigarette. The spot of light disappeared for a
second and reappeared again in a swift, descending
arc cut off by the bows. The smoker had thrown
away his cigarette.</p>

<p>For several minutes Trask watched and listened.
The man on the forecastle head coughed gently, and
then came clumping aft, dropped to the main deck with
a smack of bare feet, and drew the scuttle aside, to put
his head and shoulders down.</p>

<p>"It's all right!" Trask heard him whisper, hoarsely.
He recognized him as Shope. The light coming up
through the scuttle illuminated the foremast above
Trask's head in a manner disconcerting. Trask
ducked down under the boom.</p>

<p>All was silence below, and then the creaking of the
steps leading up, and the light below went out. There
were sounds of men coming on deck, known to Trask<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
by the rattle of the scuttle as incautious shoulders
rasped it coming out, making the board rattle in its
grooves.</p>

<p>There was a conference in guarded whispers, and
someone started aft along the starboard side. Trask
could make him out as he passed, and after he had
disappeared against the blackness made by the fore
bulkhead of the cabin there was a peculiar rattle
along the deck in his wake.</p>

<p>Trask was now thoroughly alarmed. The crew
could not be out on deck whispering and moving about
with such secrecy with any good intent toward those
who had made the voyage possible.</p>

<p>The rattle along the deck continued, and dropping
to his hands and knees, Trask crawled to the starboard
side. He encountered a small, hard line, like a lead-line,
being paid out from the forecastle and carried aft
by the man who had passed. Trask put his hand upon
it and let it run through his fingers for a second.</p>

<p>There came a slight patter of rain and Trask made
his way toward the cabin, not so much to avoid a
wetting, as to be where he could alarm Jarrow and
Locke if there appeared to be any necessity to investigate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the actions of the crew.</p>

<p>It was all rather absurd, he thought. There was
nothing especially sinister about sailors carrying a line
aft. To demand what it was about and make himself
known would only serve to make him ridiculous if the
explanation proved to be the carrying out of some
legitimate duty. Being quiet, with the vessel at
anchor, was hardly to be condemned. And if it turned
out that the crew were preparing trouble it was no
time to show that they were being watched unless the
danger were imminent.</p>

<p>He stepped into the galley and felt along the bulkhead
for the row of knives he had seen in their leathern
pockets. He pulled out a large one, judging its size
by the thickness of its handle. It was a formidable
weapon.</p>

<p>Dinshaw was still breathing musically. So far as
Trask could tell, all hands in the cabin were asleep.
He passed through with great care, smiling at the
figure he would cut if he were challenged and found
with a great knife in his hands sneaking about the
cabin. He, rather than the crew, would be held
guilty of some dangerous intention against the safety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of the schooner.</p>

<p>The rain was now striking the cabin roof with sweeping
gusts. It was not a heavy downpour, but a threat
of more to come, the weak advance guard of an
approaching deluge.</p>

<p>Ascending the companion, he put his head out far
enough to see a shape moving at the taffrail, evidently
a man bent over some task. Then it moved away to
starboard, slowly, and Trask heard a gentle blowing,
as one might make in clearing the nostrils of rain.</p>

<p>Trask now felt rather ashamed of himself. Instead
of an attack on the cabin, the man who had come aft
had gone about his business and departed. There
was nothing to be alarmed about in that, surely.</p>

<p>So Trask went to the forward door and looked out
on deck, putting the knife away in the galley without,
however, attempting to insert it in the leather sheath.
Then he stood in the doorway, and listened.</p>

<p>The man could be seen moving along the starboard
side slowly. Trask caught a foreign sound, a gurgle
which he at first mistook for rain water running from
the scuppers. But the deck was scarcely wet and,
besides, the sound was to starboard. Water running<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
off would go to port, for the schooner was heeled a
little in that direction.</p>

<p>Soon there was a rasping along the hull, and emboldened
by the fact that the man who had brought
the line aft was now well forward, Trask stepped to the
bulwark and looked over the side.</p>

<p>At first he could see nothing in the blackness below,
but a new flurry of rain came, and the drops striking
the water hissingly made it slightly luminous, outlining
a dark, formless mass close to the side of the
schooner. It moved forward slowly, its progress
coincident with the movement of the man going along
the rail. Trask could see his head and shoulders
against the fog-like sheen of the water over the
bows.</p>

<p>At once the whole affair was made plain to Trask.
The dinghy, which had been lowered from the after
davits when the <i>Nuestra</i> anchored, was being stolen!
The crew were pulling it forward by the line which the
man had taken aft, and this man was keeping the boat
clear of the schooner's side. The line evidently had
been made fast to the dinghy's painter.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, was something which gave every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
appearance of being underhand work. With the
Golden Isle only a few hundred yards distant, and all
hands to go ashore in the morning, there could be no
other reason for stealing the dinghy than a plan to
visit the island under cover of darkness. The plan
foreshadowed treachery. The crew sought some
knowledge which they wanted before the other members
of the expedition could be aware of conditions on
the island.</p>

<p>Trask saw at once the purpose of the crew, although
he had no way of knowing how they intended to gain
any advantage to themselves unless they contemplated
abandoning the <i>Nuestra</i>, or destroying it and those
remaining aboard. He had no doubt the scheme was
to learn whether or not there was gold, and so to act, in
the event they found it in great quantities, that they
would be assured of having it for themselves.</p>

<p>It was a wild idea, this going out in the night to hunt
gold. But it was plain that the cupidity of the crew
had been aroused by the prospect of a shining, yellow
beach. But what was to Trask far more important,
and fraught with danger to Marjorie, Locke, Dinshaw,
Jarrow, and himself, was the knowledge that Peth, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
not the leader of the enterprise, at least must be aware
of what was taking place.</p>

<p>The rain came on now with steady, monotonous
force, turning the sea into a boiling cauldron. Trask,
drenched in the first minutes of the downpour, remained
where he was, crouching under the bulwark
with his head high enough to get the bulwark forward
against the gray luminosity of the beaten water.</p>

<p>So concealed, if it could be called concealment, in
the darkness of the schooner, he saw four figures go
over the side, and heard them fumbling in the dinghy.
They pushed off gently and rowed away in the direction
of the island, amid the muffled click of oars.
Before proceeding but a few yards the boat was lost to
him in the welter of steaming water and all-enveloping
blackness.</p>

<p>Trask suffered from a chill, but he remained where
he was, wondering what could, or should, be done.
Jarrow must be warned. The sky now turned lighter,
being relieved of its burdened clouds, and the rain began
to fall off, until it was merely a gentle trickle.</p>

<p>Dripping like a water spaniel returning to the shore,
Trask turned in to the door of the main cabin, planning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to rid himself of his wet clothing, get into some dry
garments, and call Jarrow.</p>

<p>As he felt his way into the deeper gloom he heard
a movement close at hand, and stopped, leaning
against the bulkhead, just abaft of the galley. He
saw that the light from outside marked the cabin door
as a great rectangle in which a moving form could
easily be seen from the inside.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" came a whisper.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Trask, whispering, but
more boldly, and with something of defiance in his
tone.</p>

<p>"Doc Bird, Mr. Trask," came the answer. "Fo'
the lan' sake, what yo' all doin' out in the rain,
man?"</p>

<p>"Keep quiet," said Trask, unpleasantly aware of
rivulets racing down his heels. He followed the bulkhead
straight aft, conscious that Bird was in the doorway
of the cook's room, past Dinshaw's room, to the
door of Jarrow's, which he opened softly.</p>

<p>"Captain Jarrow!" he called, in a low voice. "Captain
Jarrow!"</p>

<p>There was no reply. He listened for the regular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
breathing of the sleeping captain. Then he went
inside and felt along Jarrow's bunk. The sheet
was rumpled and thrown back but Jarrow was not

<h2><span class="smcap">Captain Jarrow Admits He Is Suspicious of
Peth</span></h2>


<p>Trask went to his room at once, and stripping
off his wet pajamas, dressed hurriedly.
His discovery that Jarrow was missing seemed
to verify his suspicions that the captain was not playing
fair. His absence from his room was the most
alarming thing which had happened yet aboard the
<i>Nuestra</i>, and, as Trask saw it, the fact pointed to a
betrayal of trust.</p>

<p>But the young man decided he would withhold any
decision regarding the captain until the latter had a
chance to explain why the crew should put off in a
boat in the night, and why Jarrow was not in his cabin.
There might be a reason for it all which would be perfectly
plausible, if not convincing of the captain's good
intentions.</p>

<p>Doc came to the door of his room, and whispered:
"Yo' all want the lamp goin', Mr. Trask?"</p>

<p>"No," said Trask. "You go to bed and keep still."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
He felt that the steward was inordinately curious
about the visit to the captain's room and why Trask
was walking about outside.</p>

<p>"Cap'n Jarrow, he's gone for'ard," offered Doc,
still standing in the frame of the door, barely perceptible.</p>

<p>"Forward!" whispered Trask, surprised. This
news meant one of two explanations for what he had
seen&mdash;the business was legitimate, and under the
direction of Jarrow, or Jarrow was involved with the
crew in whatever treachery was afoot.</p>

<p>"Yassir," continued Doc. "He's got all hands
messin' 'round at somethin'. I reckon the old man he
looks for it to come on to blow."</p>

<p>"I see," said Trask. "Well, I'm going out. Maybe
I can be of some help. Keep quiet, or you'll wake
everybody up."</p>

<p>Doc withdrew from the door, and Trask heard him
shuffling to his own room, expressing some opinion in a
whisper which Trask could not make out, except that
it was to the effect that he hadn't started this "walkin'
round like ha'nts in the middle of the night."</p>

<p>Trask went on deck and moved forward boldly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
The squall which had passed left the air fresh and
cool, and the sky was not so black, although the
schooner was still in gloom. But her bulwarks were
more clearly defined against the water, and Trask
could see a figure on the starboard bow which looked
like a man standing and peering in the direction of the
island.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" came Jarrow's voice as Trask drew
near. His voice was low and cautious.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trask."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"Can't sleep," said Trask. "What's going on?"</p>

<p>"Storm wake ye up?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. I've been wakeful since I went to
my room."</p>

<p>"Guess we woke ye up."</p>

<p>"Well, I've heard considerable movement, and it
made me curious."</p>

<p>"How long ye been out?"</p>

<p>"I was out when it first rained."</p>

<p>"Oh, then it was you!"</p>

<p>"I? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Loafin' along the rail."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I stood there for awhile."</p>

<p>"Thought you was one of the men soldierin' on the
job."</p>

<p>"I saw a boat put off."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jarrow, as if neither the boat nor the
fact that Trask had seen it was of any interest to him.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked Trask.</p>

<p>Jarrow made no reply, but stepped off the forecastle
head with a noise of wet, swishing oilskins, and
fumbled for a minute. Then the lantern in the forestay
bobbed down and up, and he came back to where
Trask stood.</p>

<p>Presently the captain struck a match, and twisted
his head to one side to light a cigar, his eyes peering at
him over the flame.</p>

<p>"Didn't do much good to keep quiet so you could
sleep," said Jarrow, grinning into the flame. Then he
puffed hard at the cigar.</p>

<p>"Naturally, I'm filled with expectation about the
island," said Trask. He knew Jarrow was none too
cordial, and seemed bent on showing disapproval of
Trask's being abroad.</p>

<p>"You better git some sleep," said Jarrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you look for bad weather?" asked Trask.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jarrow, with sudden heartiness. "I
look for anything in these latitudes at this season. At
ten o'clock the barometer showed a disturbance of the
diurnal range. It's below maximum."</p>

<p>"Typhoon?"</p>

<p>"Maybe. But I'm takin' no chances. I've got
the crew out with a kedge anchor, up in that channel
behind the reef, to haul in there if things look bad.
Lie snug as a bug in a rug. That reef's a natural
breakwater."</p>

<p>"Then the boat took out a kedge?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Peth go, too?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Mr. Peth he's out there. He's got an
anchor laid out in the boat, to buoy it. He's sounding
along inside the reef. We'll take a hawser out in the
mornin', but if the weather falls, we can make fast
right away. He'll run a heavin' line from the buoy
so we can find it in the dark. I take it you're satisfied,
Mr. Trask?"</p>

<p>"Satisfied? Certainly." Trask was surprised at
the sharpness and obvious animus in Jarrow's question.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
His tone, despite the fact that he spoke scarcely
above a whisper, carried a sneer. Trask was on the
point of asking Jarrow if he had ever questioned his
methods of navigation or seamanship, but he held his
tongue for it was no time to precipitate a quarrel.</p>

<p>Trask suspected that Jarrow had overheard him in
some remark about the delay of the schooner getting
up to the island, or had caught disapproval in his
manner that afternoon. It was natural enough for a
sailing master to resent the slightest implication that
he was not efficient, and Trask was not so much concerned
with Jarrow's hidden meaning on that score as
with his covert acknowledgment that he had been
watchful of Trask's attitude. It was something to
know that Jarrow was keen enough to divine the fact
that Trask was secretly critical.</p>

<p>"I guess you thought we was slow in makin' anchorage,"
suggested Jarrow.</p>

<p>This abruptness in reaching the very subject which
Trask was considering made him wary of the captain.
It was plainly a bid for an expression of Trask's ideas.
Jarrow was angling for Trask's opinion to learn
whether he might be easily misled, or perhaps ascertain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
if Trask's coming out to investigate now was part of
his general feeling that Jarrow was not to be trusted.</p>

<p>"Well, naturally," said Trask, after a moment's
hesitation, "we were anxious to get here as soon as
possible, yet we realized that you had to take precautions."</p>

<p>"Can't take no chances with this kind of a bottom,"
said Jarrow. "Might be easy to git in through them
coral patches, but I've got to know how to git out, and
how to git out under the worst conditions. Some of
them patches probably break with the least little sea
on. If I had to beat out against a head wind in the
dark, I don't want to pile up on breakers with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jarrow stopped to listen. The sound of oars came
to their ears off toward the black shape of the island.</p>

<p>"You better git some sleep," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"All right," said Trask. "Good-night, captain."</p>

<p>"Good-night, sir. And don't you be worried none
about noises out here. I'm a-lookin' after things."</p>

<p>"Did you think I was worried?" asked Trask,
stopping.</p>

<p>This was apparently a poser for Jarrow, who took
his cigar out of his mouth, and was a full minute in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
framing a reply. Trask would have given a good deal
to see his face.</p>

<p>"I didn't take you that way," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>Trask went back beside him. The young man felt
that it was a mistake to allow Jarrow to dismiss him as
he had, with the curt suggestion that he go back to bed.</p>

<p>"Then I want to assure you," said Trask, speaking
slowly and in a tone intended to carry conviction of
just how he felt, "that I'm not the worrying kind,
Captain Jarrow. And if Mr. Peth gets to acting up,
I'm prepared to deal with him myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, hush!" said Jarrow, in a low whisper. "We
can't have any talk like that for'ard here."</p>

<p>"I don't care who hears me," went on Trask, determined
to carry out his bluff. "I've been out on deck
for quite a while, and to be frank, I didn't like the idea
of a boat going off this way. If it's your plan to kedge,
and you think it is necessary, all right. I'm not a
sailor. But I do know you haven't got Mr. Peth or
the crew very well in hand, so if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush up, Mr. Trask, for God's sake!" implored
Jarrow, stepping over to Trask and putting his hand on
his arm. "There is trouble brewing, but I don't know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
what it's about. I'm holdin' things off till the mornin'.
I don't look for nothin' to come of it."</p>

<p>"Trouble? What sort of trouble?" demanded
Trask, amazed at the captain's revelation.</p>

<p>"I don't know," admitted Jarrow. "May be
everythin' and nothin'. It's that Peth's too thick
with the crew, and it's bad when a mate gits to
standin' out with the fo'c's'le agin the master."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to understand that it's&mdash;mutiny?"</p>

<p>"I said I don't know what it is, Mr. Trask."</p>

<p>"How about Bevins? Is he in on it, too?"</p>

<p>"All hands. They're off there in the dinghy now,
and I don't know what they're up to."</p>

<p>"So you're not putting out a kedge?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. That was to git you back to your bunk.
I was out on deck before you was, and Peth sneaked the
dinghy. I suppose they've got some fool idea that
there's a lot of gold on the island, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jarrow broke off and said no more. Trask thought
he had heard something and waited for him to go on,
but after a long pause the captain did not seem inclined
to say anything more, but took long pulls on his
cigar, which he kept shaded from the sea behind his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
hand.</p>

<p>Trask's mind worked rapidly. If anything, the
truth from Jarrow that there was danger from Peth
and the crew had steadied him, and while he realized
his helpless position if Jarrow were deceiving him, he at
least had proof of a desperate situation aboard the
schooner.</p>

<p>"What do you think they would do if they found
gold on the island, captain?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me. Might come back and burn the
<i>Nuestra</i>."</p>

<p>"Sounds interesting," said Trask.</p>

<p>"Mebbe you think I'm jokin' of you?" said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"Not at all. I wouldn't put murder beyond that
lot. There's something I've wanted to tell you since
we left Manila, but I didn't want to do anybody an injustice."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Somebody stole one of my automatic pistols before
I'd been aboard a quarter of an hour."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was taken from my bag in my room."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mighty Nelson! You should ha' told me, Mr.
Trask! Who do ye think got it?"</p>

<p>"I've every reason to suspect Mr. Peth. It was
missing right after he moved his stuff out of my room.
The bag had been opened and closed again very carefully,
strapped and buckled. The man who took it
had plenty of time and wanted to make sure he wasn't
suspected right away. At least, he didn't want the
loss noticed at once."</p>

<p>"So Mr. Peth's got an automatic gun, eh?" said
Jarrow, rather in a musing way, and drawing a deep
breath.</p>

<p>"I might not have missed it for days," went on
Trask, "but I had two, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Two!"</p>

<p>"I had a pair of them."</p>

<p>"And Peth got away with both of 'em!"</p>

<p>"No, only one. I have the other, and Mr. Locke has
two. I went down to oil mine after Peth moved out,
and found one gone when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then we're all right," said Jarrow. "If you and
Mr. Locke brought guns we don't need to worry. I've
got a couple, myself. I guess we can handle anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
that carries away for'ard here."</p>

<p>"Why did you move the lantern?" demanded
Trask.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Jarrow, "I had a mind to take it down
so they couldn't find their way back to the schooner
till mornin' unless it cleared up in good shape. But it
won't clear. Smells like more rain."</p>

<p>"I think it's a good scheme," said Trask. "Let 'em
stay off in the boat. Then we'll put Peth in irons
when he comes aboard in the morning if we think he's
been up to mischief, or plans trouble. We can handle
the others. We can't take any chances with Miss
Locke aboard."</p>

<p>"You're right!" said Jarrow. "I'll douse the glim
and let 'em stay. If they want to cut up any didoes
we can work the <i>Nuestra</i> back to Manila ourselves and
the government'll take care of 'em for us."</p>

<p>Jarrow clumped down off the forecastle head and
lowered the lantern, clapped his sou'wester over it, and
snuffed the flame out between his fingers. Trask
observed the grimness of his face as the light played on
it during the brief instant the lantern was coming down
and the determined set of his jaw as his teeth gripped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the cigar.</p>

<p>They stood in the darkness, silent for a few minutes,
listening, and caught again the rattle of oars in locks
at quite a distance. The boat seemed to be moving
about cautiously, feeling its way in behind the reef.</p>

<p>"I can't make out what the devil they're up to,"
said Jarrow in a grumbling sort of whisper. "Peth
never did have much sense. Sometimes I've thought
he was clean out of his head."</p>

<p>"Then you've had doubts about him since we left
Manila?"</p>

<p>"No, can't say's I have. I don't pay no attention
to his tantrums gene'lly. He's up and he's down, just
how he feels. But he picked this crew from a lot of his
old shipmates so they'll stand by him if he's set on
makin' trouble, and he knows it. I didn't like the
looks of things to-day, so I kept my weather eye
peeled. He lowered the dinghy on his own, without
sayin' a word<!--**changed typo world to word--> to me, and I smelled a rat, so I kept
watch. I didn't want to git you folks scared up, so
when you come out I thought I'd pass it off and wait
to see what their game was. I wouldn't say nothin' to
Mr. Locke 'bout it, and I'll see what's to be done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
come daylight."</p>

<p>"Do you think they'll make a fight if you don't let
'em aboard?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't do no good if they did. We can keep 'em
off, now that you and Mr. Locke have guns. They
can't live on air. You ought to try to git some sleep."</p>

<p>"I'll stick it out with you."</p>

<p>"Ain't no use of us two standin' watch all night.
You'll be all beat out to-morrow night, and with
things like they are, you won't git no chance to sleep
to-morrow. If they come back, I'll call you in time to
have the weather on 'em."</p>

<p>Jarrow's advice sounded sensible enough. With
the crew out in a boat there was little imminent danger,
and Trask felt that it would be wise to remain aft,
for if the crew suspected their game was known they
might attempt to board the schooner from the stern.
They would probably interpret the disappearance of
the riding light as discovery aboard the schooner that
they were missed and their treachery revealed to the
heads of the expedition.</p>

<p>So Trask decided to go back to his room, even if he
did not sleep, and being assured by Jarrow that immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
there was any sign of the boat he would be
called, he made his way aft and went to bed fully
dressed except for his shoes.</p>

<p>He had scarcely rolled into his bunk before he heard
cautious footsteps in the cabin, and Doc Bird came
scratching at his door.</p>

<p>"I reckon somethin's powerful wrong, Mr. Trask,"
he whispered.</p>

<p>"You get out of here and go to bed," said Trask.
"And don't show a light for any reason until you have
orders to."</p>

<p>"I got to be up early to make flapjack batter fo' yo'
all," was Doc's reply. "I reckon I'll have to have a
light in the galley and the fire goin' right smart long
befo' the chickens is crowin' fo' day."</p>

<p>Trask knew it would do no good to get out of
patience with Doc, for he was incorrigibly persistent
and friendly in the face of any rebuff.</p>

<p>"Don't make any fire or light any lamps until you're
told to," Trask reiterated. "And for heaven's sake,
let me and everybody else get some sleep. Get some
for yourself. Run along."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't yo' fret none fo' me, Mr. Trask. I'm a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
regular squinch owl," and he chuckled audibly, as if
his ability to do without sleep were a rare joke.</p>

<p>"I'm not," retorted Trask, and rolled over significantly.</p>

<p>"You don't reckon Mr. Peth he's actin' up none, do
ye? The skipper he goes walkin' 'round like he had
somethin' wearin' down on his mind."</p>

<p>"You better ask him, Doc," said Trask.</p>

<p>"Huh! Ketch me goin' out and confabbin' around
with the ol' man! He'd shore hang somethin' on mah
haid. Mr. Trask, 'fo' God, I can't git no sleep when
I'm a-worried. It all kind o' makes my skin go all
crawly when there's somethin' projectin' around and I
don't know of it. Yo' shore there ain't nothin' bad
nohow?"</p>

<p>"There will be, if you don't get out of that door! Go
bring some water."</p>

<p>Doc gurgled with a suppressed chuckle, and went to
the galley, where he could be heard pulling a cork in
the dark. He was back in a minute, and handed a
glass in to Trask, who sat up to take it and drink.</p>

<p>"If somebody hadn't a-swiped that gun o' yourn, I
would take no bother of it if Mr. Peth gits contrary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've got another gun," said Trask. "And Mr.
Locke has two."</p>

<p>Doc was silent for a time, as if he were pondering the
matter.</p>

<p>"Yo' all shore come a-lookin' for b'ar," he opined,
taking the glass which Trask thrust out at him. "But
yo' all don't need to be squirmish about Mr. Peth.
If he goes to act up, I'll settle his hash."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>Doc chuckled again.</p>

<p>"I know how to handle that low-down trash," he
whispered, tragically. "I'd drap somethin' in his tea.
Good-night, Mr. Trask."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Doc. Don't make a light."</p>

<p>"No, sah," and the steward crept away to his bunk,
leaving Trask staring up into the dark, turning over
the situation in his mind, and waiting for the dawn.</p>



<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Mr. Peth Does Most Amazing Things</span></h2>


<p>Trask was up at dawn, and slipping out on
deck, saw Jarrow sitting on the forecastle head,
drinking coffee, a plate of biscuits beside him,
while he kept watch on the island.</p>

<p>Doc stuck his head out of the galley. "Coffee, Mr.
Trask?" he called, cautiously.</p>

<p>Trask went back and stood in the door while he
scanned the shore of the island. The sun had come
out of the sea, red and bleary, and from the jungle
came the calls of birds and the shrill cry of a
parrot evidently in distress about something in the
brush.</p>

<p>There was not a sign of the dinghy. The schooner
lay still in a pool of colourful water, the coral and
weeds on the bottom in plain view, some of the swaying
plants magnified by refraction. There was no air
stirring, and from the far end of the island a morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
haze was rising like smoke from flats which appeared to
be salt marshes.</p>

<p>Trask filled the basin at the water butt and washed
his sticky face. Doc, who evidently was astir before
the cook, became emboldened by the fact that Trask
was up, and rattled the dishes in the galley with recklessness.
Trask cautioned him when he came out with
the cup and proffered the impromptu breakfast.</p>

<p>"Have you heard anything?" he asked, as the
steward stood beside him, loath to go back to his
duties.</p>

<p>"Me? Lordy, no, Mr. Trask! We been just lak' a
buryin' ground! It gives me the creeps to have things
so daid."</p>

<p>"Seen anything of the boat?"</p>

<p>"Boat?" Doc rolled his eyes, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Go in and get breakfast," said Trask, passing the
cup back, and went along forward to learn what Jarrow
had to report.</p>

<p>"Not a sight of 'em," said the captain, who appeared
to be as fresh as if he had slept all night.</p>

<p>"That's queer," said Trask. "I thought they'd try
to sneak back during the night. What can they be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
up to? You don't think they've abandoned us
entirely?"</p>

<p>"Now ye got me," said Jarrow. "I guess Peth's
crazy in his head. He's got 'em all buggy on this gold
business, far's I can see. All right, let 'em stick to
Peth."</p>

<p>"But they'll starve," said Trask. "Suppose they
did find gold in piles? What good would it do them?
They'd have to beg to be taken back aboard here,
wouldn't they?"</p>

<p>Jarrow blew into his coffee, gulped some of it, and
raised his eyes in utter dejection to look over at the
island. The schooner lay with her head to the northeast
in response to a current that came around the
northern end of the island and almost parallel with it.</p>

<p>"When people are out of their heads, no knowin'
what they'll do," declared Jarrow. "Peth, he's always
for makin' money in heaps. He can't see beyond
his nose. Now I'm for goin' safe and sure. You ain't
got no idea how he's bothered me off and on for the last
couple years. But I had to humour him&mdash;he owns an
eighth of the <i>Nuestra</i>."</p>

<p>"He can't have much sense if he thinks gold's to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
sacked up and carted away," said Trask. "Here's
Mr. Locke."</p>

<p>"Looks like this ought to be a good place to fish,"
said Locke, coming forward. He was wearing an old
suit of white, but had on tan shoes, as if he expected to
go walking, and a shirt open at the neck. His nose
was peeled from sunburn, and he stroked it gently.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" he demanded, seeing that Jarrow
and Trask were serious-faced, each waiting for the other
to speak. He looked about the decks questioningly.</p>

<p>"The devil to pay," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"Crew's gone," said Trask.</p>

<p>"Crew! Gone! Where?"</p>

<p>"Jumped the ship in the night with the dinghy,"
said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"Say, what's the joke?" inquired Locke, blankly.
"You two look as though there was to be a hanging.
Come on&mdash;spring it!"</p>

<p>"I wish it were a joke," said Trask.</p>

<p>"The truth is, Mr. Peth and the crew left last night
with the small boat."</p>

<p>"Gone to a dance, or something, I suppose," said
Locke, still in doubt about the motives of the captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and Trask.</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Jarrow, wearily rising, to yawn into
the sun's face.</p>

<p>Locke stared at Trask, and finally realized that he
was serious. "Gone to the island?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Mainland's over there," said Jarrow, turning and
pointing over the starboard quarter. "You got two
guesses. I'll bet on the island."</p>

<p>Trask now looked in the direction indicated by the
captain and saw a low-lying ridge, barely perceptible
in the morning sun, lifting out of the horizon. It was
merely a dark streak against the edge of the sea's
brilliance, dividing sky and water.</p>

<p>"Well, that's a fine note," said Locke. "What do
they think they're getting paid for? To go away on
marine picnics?"</p>

<p>"If they come lookin' for pay, we're lucky," said
Jarrow.</p>

<p>"Now, captain, let's get down to cases," began
Locke, with a look at Trask which indicated that he
was done with temporizing with Jarrow. "What are
you going to do?"</p>

<p>Jarrow looked at him quickly, as if surprised, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
made a grimace.</p>

<p>"What do ye expect me to do?" he demanded, with
a show of temper in his voice.</p>

<p>"We'll start for Manila in an hour unless the crew's
back aboard. Can't you give 'em a signal of some
sort?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Jarrow. "I can run the Blue Peter to
the fore truck. I'm ready to go now&mdash;if you'll start
whistlin' for a wind." He wet the tip of his finger on
his tongue and held it up.</p>

<p>"You take it all-fired calm," said Locke. "What's
the idea? Are you going to sit down and wait for the
crew to make up their minds to work?"</p>

<p>"They've probably gone to the island to find gold,"
said Trask, who realized that Locke had not grasped
the situation fully. "It looks as if they won't attempt
to come back."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the game, is it?"</p>

<p>"Looks like it," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Locke, grimly. "I'll look to you,
Captain Jarrow, to carry out the terms of our agreement."</p>

<p>"What ye drivin' at?" demanded Jarrow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"This: Your pay by the day for schooner and
crew is for a definite purpose&mdash;to visit this island for
exploration purposes, and to have in our employ a
certain number of men. If we have to go back to
Manila without accomplishing the business, or lie
around waiting on the crew, it'll be out of your pocket.
It's up to you, captain."</p>

<p>"You say I don't git no money at all if we have to
go back?" Jarrow's colour heightened, and his eyes
flashed angrily, but he held a certain restraint over his
voice.</p>

<p>"What I say and what I mean."</p>

<p>"There ain't no law that compels a master to guarantee
against mutiny," said Jarrow, and began to chew
a biscuit reflectively.<!--**added missing period--></p>

<p>"Mutiny!"</p>

<p>"My mates have jumped ship with the crew.
That's mutiny."</p>

<p>"You expect them to make trouble for us?"</p>

<p>"I look for anything with that gang," said Jarrow.
"Peth he's a bad one when he gits started. So are all
them chaps with him. But as I see it, they'll be back
here in no time. If they don't find gold we'll have 'em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
back on our hands. So there ain't no great hurt done."</p>

<p>"But if they do find gold?" suggested Locke.</p>

<p>"They might walk on gold and not know it," said
Trask. "If they are looking for a fortune in fifteen
minutes, I doubt if they'll find it, and they'll like the
looks of this schooner pretty well."</p>

<p>"My idea exactly," said Jarrow, with a grin. "We
might as well take this as a joke. If they ain't back
by the time we have breakfast, I'll take a run over to
shore in the long boat and see 'bout huntin' 'em up.
You folks go aft, and let me handle it. I'll see it
smoothed over. We don't want to start back for
Manila short-handed if we can help it. What's the
odds, if they are a passel o' fools?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right," said Locke. "It wouldn't
look very well for us if we went back to Manila and
left them here."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what you do, captain," said Trask.
"Take a run ashore, as you said, and bring me back a
bucket of that sand."<!--**changed comma to period--></p>

<p>"I thought yould like to go over with me," said
Jarrow.</p>

<p>"No, I'll stick by the schooner until this hitch with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the crew is straightened out."</p>

<p>"Maybe Mr. Locke'll want to go?"</p>

<p>"Not for me," said Locke. "Marjorie'll want to
go when I do, and I don't want to have anything said
about what's turned up. You take Dinshaw."</p>

<p>"I'll need two men to row," objected Jarrow. "I
might take the old fellow and the cook."</p>

<p>"We'll keep the cook," said Trask. "We can spare
Doc Bird better."</p>

<p>Jarrow agreed, and suggested that he start at once,
so Doc Bird was called and told to summon Dinshaw,
and they set about throwing off the gripes of the waist
boat and got it over the side with jury tackle in short
order.</p>

<p>"I'll take a look about and see if we can find where
they made a landin'," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"You'd better come right back, this trip," said
Trask. "It's important that I get some of that sand
under the microscope or cook a little of it."</p>

<p>"Cook it?" asked Jarrow, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I'll be able to tell in fifteen minutes
whether there's a sign of gold on that beach."</p>

<p>Dinshaw came out, in great glee over an immediate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
landing on his island, and could scarcely be restrained
from climbing over the side and into the boat long
enough to have his coffee.</p>

<p>As the final preparations were being made for the
departure of the boat, Marjorie appeared, clad in
khaki, with a short skirt and heavy shoes.</p>

<p>"I'm all ready," she cried, thinking that everybody
was embarking.</p>

<p>"We're not going yet," said Locke. "The crew's
ashore, and the captain's going to do a little reconnoitering
before we leave the schooner. We'll go right
after breakfast, though, if everything's all right."</p>

<p>Doc was all agrin, and regarded the early trip ashore
in the nature of a lark, and cast aside his white coat, to
help row in his resplendent sweater, while the cook
went about laying the table for breakfast, his round
yellow face devoid of any interest in what was going on.</p>

<p>It was decided that Dinshaw should steer, which
tickled him mightily, and Captain Jarrow plied an oar
himself.</p>

<p>"Keep a good look-out," warned Jarrow, as they
shoved off and began to pull toward the land.</p>

<p>"You bet we will," said Trask, gaily. "Don't go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
above high-water mark for that sand, but fill the
bucket from any dark spots you can find."</p>

<p>"Captain Dinshaw'll simply die of joy," said Marjorie.
"I'd hoped we might all go together and see
him land."</p>

<p>"You'd better put your hat on, Marge, or you'll have
a skinned nose," said her father. "We'll be right in to
breakfast."</p>

<p>"There's some hocus-pocus about this," whispered
Trask, as he and Locke moved forward for a private
talk.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"Jarrow's in on the deal with the crew. That's
why I wanted him out of the way for awhile so we
could figure things out. I believe that Dinshaw did
hear them say they intended to steal his island. Peth
or Jarrow got my gun, but Jarrow thinks we've three
more between us. I told him last night you had two.
He wants to get us separated."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed Locke, aghast. "You
can't mean they want to put us out of the way!"</p>

<p>"I wish I knew what they wanted to do," said Trask,<!--**changed single quote to double-->
speaking rapidly, and keeping his eyes on the boat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
which was making good headway toward the shore.
"But I believe we're in serious danger, and I don't see
now what's to be done."</p>

<p>"Jarrow is a fool," said Locke.</p>

<p>"More of a rogue. He's far more clever than we
realize. I'm sure now he signalled to Peth last night
with the lantern, when I was out here trying to see
what the crew were about with the dinghy."</p>

<p>"Then you knew it last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I found Jarrow out here on the forecastle
head. First he lit a cigar, which I suspect was a caution,
then he shook the lantern, probably to indicate
that their absence was discovered, and then he put
the lantern out. He said it was so they couldn't find
their way back in the dark, but now I'm sure it indicated
that not only was the party known to be gone,
but that their motives were suspected. What's more,
I'm sure he's had Doc Bird spying on us&mdash;at least on
me. Just as sure as I move that black is at my heels,
as full of questions as a rose is of thorns. We want to
be mighty careful with the cook, too."</p>

<p>"We're sure in a pickle," said Locke. "If there
were any wind I'd be for getting out now and leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Jarrow and all hands."</p>

<p>"My idea, too. But you'll notice he has the schooner
well in behind the barrier reef, and unless we had
a ripping good breeze, we'd pile up, or one of the boats
would overtake us before we'd have the jib set. Of
course, if we got out, it would be easy enough to make
for the mainland, or with good weather keep down the
coast until we reached some town or came up with
some vessel. But as it stands, we've got to play the
game out with Jarrow."</p>

<p>"What the dickens he expects to do, or make out
of this sort of performing is beyond me," said Locke.</p>

<p>"Probably find a lot of gold and send us back to
Manila in the hope of cheating Dinshaw out of it. I
expect they'll be disappointed if it's gold in any great
quantity they're after."</p>

<p>"But why should he and Peth be plotting together
when they're at outs?" asked Locke.</p>

<p>"It may be that Jarrow favours Peth's scheme, and
now wants to get in with him. I don't doubt they
could make up their differences if it came to a question
of hoodwinking us."</p>

<p>"Oh, sure. I don't know whether this is all funny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
or dangerous but we seem to be in the hands of a lot of
fools, and that's no joke. If it wasn't for Marge, I
wouldn't worry."</p>

<p>"Dad! Aren't you two coming to breakfast?"
Marjorie called from the door of the cabin, and then
seeing the boat approaching the shore, went to the
bulwark and watched them make a landing.</p>

<p>They saw Doc jump out and pull the boat up on the
shingle a few feet, and Jarrow hopped out after him.
Dinshaw could be seen crawling forward, and went into
the water up to his knees and ran up the beach to
fall forward and plunge both hands into the sand in an
ecstasy of joy. Those in the schooner could hear his
high-pitched voice as he cackled gleefully.</p>

<p>Then they saw him talking with Jarrow, and pointing
to seaward over the reef, and evidently going over
the details of how he came ashore from the <i>Wetherall</i>,
and where the bark struck.</p>

<p>Doc stood near by, listening, and kicking the sand with
one foot. Jarrow made a gesture to him, and the steward
went back to the boat and brought a bucket, which
he began to fill with sand close to the water's edge.</p>

<p>Jarrow put his hands up to his face, to make a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
trumpet, and called loudly for "Mr. Peth" several
times. His voice was thrown back from the hill over
the water in long-drawn echoes that died away in the
murmur of the gentle surf breaking on the other side
of the point and along the backbone of the main reef.</p>

<p>"For all the world like paging a gorilla," chuckled
Locke. They went aft and stood by Marjorie, and
Shanghai Tom looked out from the cabin door, white-capped
and white-aproned, and a trifle bored.</p>

<p>Jarrow moved up nearer the rim of the jungle, and
was rendered almost invisible to those on the schooner
against the glittering white sand.</p>

<p>Doc put his bucket in the boat, and stood by the
bow, looking after the captain. Once he turned toward
the schooner, and waved his hand. Dinshaw
was moving toward the point slowly, head bent, making
a careful examination of the shore, stooping now
and then to pick up a handful of sand and let it run
through his fingers.</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;over beyond Captain Dinshaw&mdash;in the
brush!" said Marjorie, pointing.</p>

<p>A figure in blue emerged cautiously from the tangle
of green shrubbery some hundred yards to the right of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Jarrow&mdash;Peth, in a suit of dungarees. He stepped
out into the sand and stood with his arms akimbo,
watching Jarrow, who was looking in the other direction.</p>

<p>Presently Jarrow turned and saw Peth, and started
toward him slowly, apparently in some doubt as to the
attitude of the mate toward him. When he had advanced
to within twenty feet of Peth he stopped, and
from his gestures, he seemed to be talking. At times
he looked over his shoulder toward Dinshaw, and
pointed out to the schooner as if ordering the mate to
return on board.</p>

<p>Peth kicked the sand but made no move to obey.
Jarrow drew nearer, and his hands became more
eloquent, as if he were arguing with Peth to bring the
crew back and return to duty. Dinshaw, now well up
to the point, went on with his explorations, and gave
no heed to Jarrow and Peth, if, indeed, he had seen
them at all.</p>

<p>Jarrow turned to the shore and called something,
and Doc went across and stood near by while the pair
continued their conversation. Dinshaw heard the
summons, and looked back, but had no interest in what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
was going on, for he resumed his trudging, stopping
frequently to look about him as if searching for some
landmark.</p>

<p>The parley between Peth and Jarrow lasted several
minutes, and then other heads and shoulders appeared
in the brush, peering out. Jarrow's voice, raised
threateningly, reached those in the schooner in a
rumbling sort of growl, although they could not distinguish
his words. He appeared to be exasperated
that his crew should stand about in the jungle and
refuse to obey his orders.</p>

<p>Finally Jarrow waved his hand to Doc, and turned
to follow the steward, when Peth ran forward, and
stepped between Jarrow and Doc. He whipped out a
pistol and pointed it at the captain.</p>

<p>The others came out of the brush at this, and Doc
took to his heels, running for the boat like a deer.</p>

<p>Jarrow put his hands up, and roared out something
angrily to the effect that he'd "settle this business if it
cost him his life," and as the crew closed in around him
he shouted wildly toward the schooner: "Mutiny!
Mutiny!"</p>

<p>Doc reached the long boat and making frantic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
efforts to push it off finally got it afloat, and with an
oar shoved it into deep water and began to scull it
out rapidly, making a zigzag course for the schooner.</p>

<p>"Can you beat it?" demanded Locke. "They've
taken Jarrow prisoner! Now we are in for it!"</p>



<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Trask Makes a Discovery</span></h2>


<p>"The crazy fools!" exclaimed Trask, as he saw
Jarrow being hustled into the jungle by the
crew. "What sort of game do you suppose
this is? Have they all gone mad?"</p>

<p>"Mutiny!" said Marjorie. "Why should they
mutiny?"</p>

<p>"Search me," said her father, disgustedly. "We
seem to have brought a fine pack of maniacs with us."</p>

<p>They could see Dinshaw exploring the beach, apparently
oblivious of what had happened, or careless
of the quarrels which Jarrow and Peth might have, so
long as he was on his beloved island.</p>

<p>So the watchers in the schooner gave their attention
to Doc, who continued to drive the long boat ahead
jerkily, working as though he expected to be pursued
from ashore and prevented from gaining the <i>Nuestra</i>.</p>

<p>"What was that all about?" demanded Trask, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the steward, breathing hard and to every appearance
terror-stricken, brought the long boat alongside the
schooner.</p>

<p>"Lordy me!" he gasped, his eyes white and rolling.
"They shore messed up things this yer time!" He
quit sculling and stood up in the stern of the boat, allowing
it to make the distance which separated it from
the schooner by its own momentum.</p>

<p>"But what did they say?" demanded Locke.</p>

<p>"It's Mr. Peth," said Doc, and turning, looked
ashore. "He's got the skipper up a tree. Ah tell yo'
all that man Peth, he's a danger! Yassir!" He
made the boat fast, and scrambled up the ladder and
over the side.</p>

<p>"Now," said Trask, "tell us everything that you
heard."</p>

<p>"Mr. Trask, fo' Gawd, if you'll slip me a gun, I'll go
back en blow dat man's haid off'n his neck! Mr.
Peth he don't need to think he's goin' do no foolin'
round with me, no, suh! I'm jest as mean as anybody
when I'm stirred up, en I'm mad to mah marrer! If
I'd had a gun&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're more of a sprinter than a shooter, if I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
any judge," said Locke. "Never mind what you'll do.
What did you hear?"</p>

<p>"Well, suh," said Doc, scratching his head, "I was
a just sort of circulatin' 'round when I filled that
bucket. I wanted to see what Mr. Peth was projectin'
about wid the skipper, so I jest aidged up, closer en
closer, when the cap'n he call me to shuffle along.</p>

<p>"They was a-talkin', kind o' low lak'. Mr. Peth he
was a-sayin' how they all been fooled 'cause there
ain't no gold on the island nohow. How they done
dug en dug, but nary any gold. And Mr. Peth he
'lowed he was there for gold, and not a-gitten' any,
he was goin' to be paid, en paid big, en all hands
wanted a batch o' money. He said nobody comin'
back here nohow, en how Jarrow'll have to stay there
with 'em ontil they was paid.</p>

<p>"De old man he 'lowed he ain't no bank on wheels,
and Mr. Peth he say back he don't care whar de money
come f'om, he's gwine have it, en he slash up wid a gun
en say to come along, en come quick. Then the
others come out o' de woods, lookin' mighty mad, en I
says to mahse'f, 'Doc Bird, this ain't no place for you
to be circulatin' 'round, not if yo' wants fo' to die of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
old age,' so I jump fo' de boat."</p>

<p>"So it's a hold-up," said Locke, looking at Trask.</p>

<p>"You've got it," said Trask. "They set out to get
gold, and can't find it. Now they think we'll pay
them a good price to get out."</p>

<p>"We'll get out without any help from them," said
Locke.</p>

<p>"You better not go pullin' up no anchors in this
pocket," advised Doc, as he saw Locke look over the
bows speculatively. "Yo' all would go smack on that
yer reef, the way the tide's got a set."</p>

<p>"How much do they want?" asked Marjorie, who
was more amused than worried at the way things had
turned out.</p>

<p>"You'll have to ask Mr. Peth," said Doc.</p>

<p>"You get in the boat and go back ashore and get
Dinshaw," said Trask. "If you see any of the crew,
simply say we'll take the matter of paying them extra
under advisement when we know what their idea is."</p>

<p>"Mr. Trask," said Doc, solemnly, "I'll go back if
you give me a gun. I ain't 'fraid of no man what
stands on two laigs if I got shootin' things. But I
ain't goin' back with my bar' hands, for Dinshaw nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the 'Postle Paul, no, suh!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you want a gun, eh?" said Trask. "I'll bet
you couldn't hit the island from here with a gun."</p>

<p>"Show me the gun," said Doc, eagerly. "I was in
the army, if yo' all want to know. I got medals, yes,
suh!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Trask. "Go in and serve breakfast
and I'll give you a gun. Then we'll see what you
can do."</p>

<p>Doc made for the cabin, and Shanghai Tom followed
him, to whisper in the galley about what had happened.</p>

<p>"We'll be in in a minute," said Trask, and with a
knowing smile Marjorie left the deck. Trask and
Locke strolled forward.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" asked the older man.</p>

<p>"It's a mad scheme on the face of it," said Trask.
"That's why I wouldn't undertake to say how it will
turn out. But there's one thing I'm sure of."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The steward is crooked. He's too anxious to find
out how many guns we have and too anxious to go
back ashore. He's a spy."</p>

<p>"Then we wouldn't be wise to attempt to get the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
schooner out with his help," suggested Locke.</p>

<p>"He doesn't want us to try it, that's plain," said
Trask. "I've an idea to test him out. It'll take a
little time, but we might as well set out to see who's
who in this crowd."</p>

<p>"That gang ashore'll try to get back here," said
Locke, looking over at the island. "They can't live
on sand and water."</p>

<p>"Come to breakfast," said Trask. "Just leave
things to me, and talk about our guns. We've got to
give the impression that we're a young arsenal."</p>

<p>They passed into the cabin, and Trask took the
occasion to slip into the galley while Doc and Tom
were absent, and lifting out an old rat-tail file, which
the cook used to sharpen his knives on, slipped it up
the sleeve of his jacket.</p>

<p>They sent Doc out on deck to keep watch and Trask
ordered him to get the bucket of sand out of the boat.</p>

<p>"Don't you feel worried about this, Miss Trinkets,"
said Locke, as Marjorie looked up doubtful.</p>

<p>"Do you think it's serious, Dad?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Serious! Not at all! We'll get out of here as
soon as there's a breath of air, and leave that wild lot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to themselves."</p>

<p>"But poor old Dinshaw," she said, "and Captain
Jarrow&mdash;what's to become of them?"</p>

<p>"We'll have to get Dinshaw, of course," said Trask.
"I'll take Doc and go for him at once with the boat."
He drank his coffee hastily, and went out on deck. He
disappeared into the forecastle and was below for
several minutes.</p>

<p>"Do you think you ought to risk going ashore?"
asked Locke, when Trask returned with the bucket of
sand.</p>

<p>"I don't believe they'll bother me," said Trask, and
calling to Tom to bring him a frying pan, he measured
out two or three cupfuls of sand and spread it carefully
in the pan.</p>

<p>Then, to the amazement of all of them, he put the
pan on the galley fire, and calling Doc, told him to
watch the sand, and when it got well heated, to call
him.</p>

<p>"Cookin' sand!" exclaimed Doc, with a suspicious
look at Trask. "Ah never did hear of such a thing!
What fo' yo' doin' it, Mr. Trask?" He made no
attempt to conceal the fact that he doubted the young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
man's sanity.</p>

<p>"I believe there's gold in it," said Trask, simply.
"And if there is, we'll find it by heating the sand and
then cooling it with water quickly. See those dark
grains? The heat will melt the gold which you can't
see, and run it together, and then the cold water cracks
away the shell of sand, and your gold particle can be<!--*changed typo he to be-->
washed out."</p>

<p>"Beats me!" declared Doc, scratching his woolly
head, but he went to the galley with renewed interest
to watch the strange dish which Trask had prepared.</p>

<p>"Don't stir it," said Trask. "Let it get good and
sizzling."</p>

<p>"Yo' goin' cook de whole islan' in a fry pan?" asked
Doc.</p>

<p>"If there's a hundred dollars' worth of gold in a
bushel of sand, don't you think it would pay?" asked
Trask, as he went out.</p>

<p>"Some cookin'!" declared Doc.</p>

<p>Trask now searched Jarrow's cabin in the hope of
finding some sort of firearm, but there was neither
pistol nor rifle. So he took the captain's spy-glass, a
cumbersome, old-fashioned tube, and went on the poop<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
deck to look the island over.</p>

<p>But the only living thing in sight was Dinshaw, busy
scooping up sand with his hands, and building what
appeared to be sand forts. The old man was working
out near the point, close to the water's edge, piling up
sand like a harvester getting ready for the work of
gathering a crop. Mound after mound he made, in a
long furrow on a line with the shore, just above the rim
of the tide.</p>

<p>"I believe he is crazy," said Marjorie, as she looked
through the glass. "Can it be possible he thinks that
sand is gold?"</p>

<p>"That's been my suspicion for quite awhile," said
Trask.</p>

<p>Locke began to laugh. "We are the prize boobs,"
he said, "if we've come here because a cracked old man
thinks a beach is solid gold. We might have known he
was out from the way he talked."</p>

<p>"Anyway, it's lots of fun," asserted Marjorie.
"Think of it! A real mutiny, a lunatic, sand that's
supposed to be gold&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Marge, you're a hard-shell optimist," chided her
father. "Don't you realize that we're in danger?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
That a storm, or a dozen things would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I rather enjoy it, Dad. I've always wanted to do
something that was more exciting than playing tennis.
I'm glad I came."</p>

<p>Trask looked at her and grinned. As she stood
against the rail, spying out the land through an ancient
glass, seeking some sign of a crew of piratical tendencies,
he couldn't help thinking that this slender young
woman with the yellow hair coiled under a canvas hat
really was thrilled by the possibility of danger.</p>

<p>"By George! You do like it!" he said, admiringly.</p>

<p>"I'm only a little bit scared," she confessed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trask, yo' better take a look at this mess,"
Doc called up the companion. He betrayed his
suppressed excitement in his voice, and when Trask
went down, followed by the others, the steward's hands
were trembling and his eyes snapping with the spirit
of discovery which possessed him. He might have
been a scientist making a test which promised to realize
lifelong dreams and labours.</p>

<p>"Fine! It's fairly glowing!" said Trask, as he
passed a hand over the dish of sand.</p>

<p>They all pressed around him as he took a bottle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
water from Doc and dashed the liquid into the sand.
There was a cloud of steam and a terrific hissing.</p>

<p>"Now," said Trask, "pass me that wooden chopping
bowl," and he dumped the wet sand out into the bowl,
and laid it on the cabin table.</p>

<p>"Bring me another pan," he called, "and more
water."</p>

<p>He began twisting the bowl with a rotary motion,
and when Doc arrived with the pan, nursed the sand
out into it, and as the last of the sand went over the lip
of the bowl, ran out on deck into the sun, and examined
the bottom of the wooden bowl.</p>

<p>"Lordy me!" gasped Doc, leaning over Trask's
shoulder. "Look at the sparkle!"</p>

<p>The wet bowl was shot with tiny points of yellow,
which caught the sunlight.</p>

<p>"Gold!" exclaimed Marjorie.</p>

<p>"By thunder!" cried Locke. "Dinshaw's right!"</p>

<p>"Gold without a doubt," said Trask, and turned to
see Shanghai Tom staring into the bowl, his eyes fairly
popping out of his head at this magical cookery which
transformed a sea-beach into glittering wealth.</p>

<p>Trask resumed the washing, and in a few minutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
had as much of the yellow powder as he could hold in
the hollow of a palm.</p>

<p>"Man alive!" remarked the gleeful Doc. "I
reckon we better take this yere island apart, right
down level to the water!"</p>

<p>"There's millions on it," declared Trask. "When
four cups of sand will assay that much gold, consider
what's in a mile of beach like this."</p>

<p>"It's a new one on me," said Locke. "I never saw
such a thing in my life and&mdash;&mdash; Hello! Here's the
boat coming out!"</p>

<p>They ran to the rail, and looking shoreward, saw the
dinghy, with two men rowing it, and Peth and Jarrow
sitting in the stern sheets. They were heading
straight for the schooner.</p>



<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">What Happened to Doc and the Dinghy</span></h2>


<p>Those aboard the <i>Nuestra</i> watched the dinghy
for a minute as it came on, the sunlight flashing
from the oars. Two men were still on the
beach, far up to the left, with their hands to their eyes,
watching the progress of the boat.</p>

<p>"Now what's the game?" asked Locke.</p>

<p>"It looks like a boarding party," said Trask. "If
they wanted to come back and behave themselves,
they'd all come. Get those dishes out of sight.
They may manage to get aboard in spite of all we can
do, but we've got to bluff 'em."</p>

<p>"We can't let 'em aboard," declared Locke.</p>

<p>Trask moved forward and mounted the forecastle,
followed by Locke.</p>

<p>"Hello, you!" called Trask.</p>

<p>The rowers ceased their work, and with suspended
oars allowed the dinghy to drift on.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Jarrow. "They want to put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
me aboard for a talk."</p>

<p>"You can't come alongside," warned Trask.
"We'll shoot if you attempt to come close," and he
put his hand to his hip pocket and pulled out his silver
cigarette case, taking care that the sun hit the upper
edge.</p>

<p>"But they want to put me back aboard for a talk
about how things stand," insisted Jarrow. "You'll
let me come, won't ye?"</p>

<p>"Not with that gang," said Trask. "Let 'em take
you ashore, and get up the beach. Then I'll come for
you with the long boat."</p>

<p>Jarrow made some suggestion to Peth, but the mate
shook his head.</p>

<p>"He says I come aboard now, this way, or not at
all," said Jarrow. "You better let me tell you how
the land lays."</p>

<p>"Nobody gets aboard here until Captain Dinshaw
is brought back," said Trask. "And I'll take one
man of the crew. The rest of 'em can stay here and
starve for all I care. It's their own funeral. They
had no business deserting the schooner."</p>

<p>"But I'm master, and that's my schooner, and I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to say what's to be done," said Jarrow. "If you try
to do that, it's piracy. I can't help it if the men refuse
duty. All I can do is the best I can for the safety of
my passengers, and if you don't let me do that, I wash
my hands of ye."</p>

<p>"You'll find your schooner in Manila," declared
Trask. "I've told you how to go about getting
aboard."</p>

<p>"I can't do what they won't let me," whined Jarrow.</p>

<p>"What do they want?" demanded Trask.</p>

<p>The boat now had no way on her, and had swung
broadside to the schooner, about a hundred yards off.</p>

<p>"They want a bonus," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"What sort of bonus?"</p>

<p>"Extra wages to work the schooner back to Manila."</p>

<p>"We won't have 'em work the schooner back to Manila
at any price."</p>

<p>"You can't git back yourself, Mr. Trask. Can't
git out of this place. It's dangerous. You'll lose her."</p>

<p>"We'd rather take the chance of losing the schooner
than have that cut-throat crew back here, I'll tell you
that. They've made their bed, now they can sleep in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
it."</p>

<p>"Be I goin' to lose all I got out of this?" wailed
Jarrow. "If you'll let 'em put me aboard, it'll come
out all right."</p>

<p>"They can have the island. We don't want it,"
said Trask.</p>

<p>"There ain't no gold," said Peth.</p>

<p>"I know it," said Trask. "Could have told you in
fifteen minutes, if you hadn't wanted to cheat Dinshaw
out of it."</p>

<p>"We wouldn't a-come if we'd knowed this was a sell,"
said Peth.</p>

<p>"Weren't you paid to come?"</p>

<p>"He ain't got no gun," yelled Doc. "The island is
full o' gold, cap'n. Yo' got to cook it an'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Trask turned to see the steward waving his hands
at the rail, and ran toward him in rage, telling him to
be still.</p>

<p>"Don' you lay han's on me!" yelled Doc, backing
away to where Shanghai Tom stood. Behind the pair
was Marjorie.</p>

<p>"So you're in with 'em, eh?" sneered Trask.</p>

<p>"I'm in fo' mahse'f!" declared Doc, lowering his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
head and regarding Trask from under his brows. He
put his hand in his pocket. "Keep away, w'ite man,
or I'll do yo'all hurt!"</p>

<p>Trask walked straight for the steward, who pulled
out a pistol.</p>

<p>"My gun!" cried Trask, stopping. Marjorie
uttered a cry of dismay as she saw the steward raise
his hand.</p>

<p>"I can shoot," warned Doc. "Come on! Come
on!" he yelled, waving his hand to the dinghy. "I
got 'em!"</p>

<p>Trask heard the splash of oars, and saw out of the
corner of his eye that the boat was coming ahead
swiftly. He was about to hurl himself at the steward
when he saw Shanghai Tom reach over Doc's shoulder
and grasp the weapon. Doc turned to resist the cook,
but Tom bent him sidewise, wrenched the pistol from
his hand so that it fell to the deck, and lifted Doc
against the bulwark. Then catching the steward's
legs, he threw him over, head first, into the sea.</p>

<p>"Good for you!" shouted Trask, and leaping forward,
grabbed up his revolver and aimed it at the
boat. "Stop!" he shouted. "Stop this minute or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
I'll fire!"</p>

<p>The rowers looked over their shoulders, and seeing
that Trask had them covered, backed water furiously
despite the shouts of Peth to go on.</p>

<p>Doc came up blowing, and began to swim toward
the dinghy without further ado. Jarrow now yelled
to the rowers to keep backing, and when Peth roared
at him to "shut his head," the captain, taking advantage
of the confusion, stood up and leaped into the
water and began swimming to the schooner quite as
fast as Doc swam away from it.</p>

<p>"Let me aboard!" cried Jarrow.</p>

<p>"All right," said Trask. "Come on!" and he came,
with an awkward, splashing, overhand stroke, like some
queer fish with one curved fin out of the water.</p>

<p>The rowers stopped backing and watched the two
swimmers, as if not sure just what to do. Peth seemed
inclined to wait and see how things turned out before
making for shore. He evidently had abandoned any
desire he had to get aboard the schooner by force.</p>

<p>Jarrow came floundering along, and managed to
reach up and grasp the stern of the long boat, when he
pulled himself up and climbed in. He stood dripping,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
dashing the water out of his eyes, and regarded the
dinghy.</p>

<p>"Get out!" he bawled, shaking his fist. "Ye can
go to the devil, the whole lot of ye!"</p>

<p>Peth made no reply, but spoke to the rowers, and
the dinghy turned slowly and headed for the island,
but waited for Doc to get alongside, when they helped
him aboard, and made off rapidly.</p>

<p>"Them blastered scoundrels!" raged Jarrow, as he
rubbed his hands down over his shirt to squeeze out the
water. "I lost my hat."</p>

<p>"Better come aboard, captain," said Trask. "Have
you a gun?"</p>

<p>"I wish I had," declared Jarrow, wrathfully. "I'd
a-let daylight through that fool of a Peth! See the
game they run on me ashore?"</p>

<p>"We did," said Locke. "You were lucky to get
away."</p>

<p>"By the Mighty Nelson!" declared Jarrow, as he
clambered over the side and hurled a shower of water
around him like a halo as he landed on the bone-white
deck. "I never did see such a passel o' fools! Plumb
bugs on gold! They think 'cause there ain't any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
we're to put a young fortune in their hands! I'll have
the coast guard on 'em, that's what, and land every
man of 'em in Bilibid for life!"</p>

<p>"Then you're for getting out?" asked Trask.</p>

<p>"You bet I am! Think I want to hang around and
palaver with a set of pirates that'd stick a gun in my
face and tell me where I git off? Not much! What's
that Doc pulled on you?"</p>

<p>"A gun," said Trask. "And my own. He had it
all the time."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be jiggered!" declared Jarrow, staring at
the weapon which Trask still held in his hand. "He's
a nice one!"</p>

<p>"A smooth article," said Trask. "He fooled me,
all right. If it hadn't been for Tom&mdash;&mdash;" He looked
around, but Tom had disappeared into the galley.</p>

<p>"I'm sure the steward would have shot you," said
Marjorie, who had regained her composure, and now
stood beside Trask.</p>

<p>"Looked like it was all off to me," said Locke.
"We'll have to square things with that Chink."</p>

<p>"What's this?" asked Jarrow, looking at the pan
and bowl, and the sand on the deck. "Been lookin'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
for gold?"</p>

<p>"Tried some of it," said Trask.</p>

<p>"Find any?" asked Jarrow, with quick interest.</p>

<p>"No," said Trask, and Locke appeared startled, but
said nothing.</p>

<p>"I better git into some dry duds," said Jarrow.
"As soon as there's a capful of wind, we'll see what
we can do about gittin' out of this hole, unless you
want to go prospectin' ashore, Mr. Trask."</p>

<p>"Not with those fellows there," said Trask, looking
over to where the boat was making a landing far up
the beach. The other two men came down to meet
the boat's crew, and there was a lively conference.</p>

<p>"But we can't go and leave poor old Dinshaw," said
Marjorie.</p>

<p>Jarrow looked at Trask questioningly.</p>

<p>"How about it?" he asked. "Are we goin' to
hang around and take chances just to pick up the
old un?"</p>

<p>"We can't leave Dinshaw," said Trask. "We've
got to get him before we think of leaving."</p>

<p>"You can suit yerself," said Jarrow. "I'm for
gittin' out. They won't hurt him. Soon's we're<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
gone, they'll all make over for the mainland. They've
got some canned meat and hard bread. They took a
lot of stuff with 'em last night."</p>

<p>Jarrow departed for his room, leaving a wet trail
behind him.</p>

<p>"He's all right," whispered Locke. "If we can get
Dinshaw, we're fixed up to leave."</p>

<p>"We'll keep an eye on the captain just the same,"
said Trask. "I rather think he's had all he wants of
Peth and the crew, even if he was going to stand in
with them at one time."<!--added missing period--></p>

<p>"Oh, I guess he's straight enough," said Locke.
"But you didn't tell him about that gold."</p>

<p>"He was keen about what you'd found," said Marjorie.
"I suppose he didn't understand what the
steward said."</p>

<p>Trask laughed, and leaning over to Locke, whispered:
"There wasn't any gold in the sand."</p>

<p>"No gold?" said Locke, staring at him.</p>

<p>"No. The 'gold' was just some brass filings I made
in the forecastle out of an old brass cleat that was
hanging on a nail in my room for a clothes hook,"
and he took from his pocket the piece of metal and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
displayed the groove he had cut in it with the file.</p>

<p>"What the dickens did you do that for?" asked
Locke.</p>

<p>"To see if Doc would stand in with the crew, although
I didn't expect it would result in his pulling a gun
on me. I thought that if he was against us, he'd try to
get back ashore with the news. Now if they think the
island is full of gold, they'll be content to stay there
and not bother us. But I didn't want to fool Jarrow.
He might not be so anxious to leave, if he had what he
thought to be proof that there was plenty of gold."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry," said Marjorie. "I'd hoped that
Dinshaw's dream had come true."</p>

<p>"Had me going all right," said Locke.</p>

<p>Before long Jarrow came out, in dry clothing, smacking
his lips after a drink, and lighted a long cigar.</p>

<p>"Now," he began, "how're we to git Looney Dinshaw
back?"</p>

<p>"Go for him with the boat," said Trask.</p>

<p>"You come along?" suggested the captain.</p>

<p>"I'll stick by the schooner," said Trask.</p>

<p>"Then I'll take the cook."</p>

<p>"Not unless the cook wants to go of his own accord,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
was Trask's reply. "I'm not going to ask Tom to do
anything."</p>

<p>"Want me to go alone?" asked the captain, in surprise.</p>

<p>"I suggest that you row up toward the point,
and call Dinshaw down to you. You can get him
easy enough, and I'll stand watch here to see that
you're not headed off by the dinghy."</p>

<p>Jarrow said nothing to this, but went aft for his
glass, and studied the group far up the beach. The
sailors were gathering wood from the jungle, and making
a pile about halfway between the edge of the forest
and the water.</p>

<p>In a few minutes a curl of white smoke was rising
from the pile they had laid.</p>

<p>"Gittin' a meal ready," was Jarrow's comment,
and he went into the cabin where Shanghai Tom was
setting the table.</p>

<p>"Doc is making a fire to melt some gold on his own
account," said Trask to Locke and Marjorie. "I wish
him luck. Dinshaw is still piling sand into little dunes
up near the point."</p>



<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">What Jarrow Wanted and What He Got</span></h2>


<p>Captain Jarrow spent an hour or two
loafing about the schooner and swearing under
his breath as he regarded the shore, where
the crew was going through mysterious incantations.</p>

<p>But Trask understood that Doc was initiating them
into the mysteries of smelting out gold from sand.
To all appearances, it was utterly devoid of anything
approaching gold.</p>

<p>Finally, after a conference with Locke and Marjorie,
Trask put before the captain the matter of bringing
Dinshaw back. But Jarrow was inclined to be sulky
about it. He objected to having "it put up to him
to bring the fool aboard," as he expressed it.</p>

<p>"None of us will leave the schooner under the
circumstances," declared Trask.</p>

<p>"But I want the cook," said Jarrow. Trask had
joined him on the forecastle and the others remained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
in the cabin.</p>

<p>"The cook stays right here with us," said Trask.
"I don't intend to take a chance at losing another
man."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to look on me as worth much,"
said Jarrow, as he gazed at the column of smoke which
rose straight in the air and hung over the island like
a volcanic vapour, spreading out into a funnel-shaped
cloud.</p>

<p>"If Peth was willing to put you on board, I don't
see that he'd interfere with you if you went ashore,"
said Trask. "As I see it, you can pull over, get Dinshaw,
and come back. You don't need to go near that
gang on the beach."</p>

<p>"Can't ye let me have the gun?"</p>

<p>"No." Trask walked away from Jarrow, satisfied
that the captain would take no action so long as there
was a possibility of continuing the argument.</p>

<p>Not long afterward, while the three in the cabin
were playing cards and Tom was preparing lunch,
Jarrow came shambling aft, and without a word went
over the side and into the long boat. When Trask
went out on deck the captain was pulling slowly for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the shore, making a course to land near where Dinshaw
was toiling in the broiling sun at his sand piling.</p>

<p>All hands deserted the cabin to see what would
happen. As the boat approached the beach, Doc
was seen to leave those about the fire, and proceed toward
Dinshaw, with the avowed purpose of heading
the captain off.</p>

<p>Jarrow made his way leisurely, and ran the boat on
the shingle. He stood watching Doc and waiting for
him, and when the steward had come close and stopped
as if in doubt as to what the captain's attitude would
be, Jarrow beckoned him on with a peremptory
gesture.</p>

<p>There was a parley, which ended with Doc returning
to the fire, and then Jarrow approached Dinshaw.
The old man looked up and waved his hand as if
pointing out the result of his labours.</p>

<p>Jarrow kicked the sand, and got down to examine
it. Then he said something to Dinshaw, and the
latter got up and followed him obediently to the boat.
Soon they were heading back for the schooner, Dinshaw
serving an oar.</p>

<p>"What's the news?" asked Trask, as the boat drew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
near.</p>

<p>"They want to come back," said Jarrow. "Peth
sends word that if you'll take 'em, they'll return to
duty if you'll call it square. Seems like they've tried
a wrinkle of burnin' the sand to git gold, but it won't
work, an' they're plumb disgusted."</p>

<p>"We won't take Peth's word about anything,"
said Trask.</p>

<p>"I guess they got a belly full o' this business," was
Jarrow's comment as he brought the boat alongside.
"You make a mistake not to take 'em up. We'd be
in a bad hole here if it come on to blow hard. Ye
better let me signal 'em back."</p>

<p>Trask said nothing to this, but helped Dinshaw over
the side. The old man seemed utterly spent, and
appeared to be in a daze from the sun. He looked
about as if he had seen none of them before, and smiled,
whispering something about gold, holding up his hands
and looking at them.</p>

<p>"He thinks the sand is gold," said Jarrow. "I
looked it over and it's no more gold than I am."</p>

<p>Marjorie spoke to Dinshaw, but he merely blinked
at her, and she took him away to the cabin and gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
him food and drink.</p>

<p>"What's this Doc said about you cookin' gold out
of sand?" asked Jarrow.</p>

<p>"Brass filings," said Trask, promptly, and took
some of the particles from his trousers pocket and
dumped them into Jarrow's palm. "Had my suspicions
of him, and wanted to see if he'd give me a
double cross. And he has the nerve to want to come
back!"</p>

<p>Jarrow grinned and examined the grains of brass,
and with a remark that it was all a crazy business,
announced his intention of getting some sleep.</p>

<p>"Call me, Mr. Trask, if this calm breaks, and we'll
git out. I'm disgusted."</p>

<p>Dinshaw had suffered a sort of collapse, or coma,
and he was put to bed likewise. Trask managed to
get up an awning, and out on deck, where they could
keep watch on shore, they lunched in comparative
comfort.</p>

<p>Locke, now satisfied that the whole venture was a
mad sort of lark, took it all in jocular mood, and
chaffed Marjorie about her desire to go adventuring
in the tropics. But Trask knew that he had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
much more worried than either himself or Marjorie,
and that his sallies were the result of his relief from
strain about how things would turn out for them.</p>

<p>Shanghai Tom had become the pet of the trio, and
while he maintained his outward imperturbability, it
was evident that he was quite proud of his exploit in
overcoming and disposing of the treacherous Doc
Bird. Trask had promised him a reward on their
return to Manila, at which he had remarked, "Me no
catchum for cash," and shook his head. The Chinaman
either from pique at the crew's total disregard of
him in their plans or from a real liking for the passengers
themselves had lined himself up on the side
of the Lockes and Trask.</p>

<p>The crew deserted their fire and took to the jungle,
leaving a pile of smouldering ashes on the sand, and
during the afternoon there was nothing to be seen of
them. The dinghy was in plain sight, pulled up on the
beach, just beyond where they had essayed their attempts
at reducing ore by the "cooking" method.</p>

<p>Trask managed to get a nap lying in a steamer chair
under his improvised awning, for it was agreed that if
they had to remain at their anchorage for the night, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
would have to share a watch with Jarrow.</p>

<p>In spite of the captain's evident desire to abandon
the crew to their fate, Trask still had a lurking suspicion
that Jarrow was more in sympathy with Peth's
demands for extra money than his heated language
against the mate implied. And the young man was
determined that he would not relax his vigilance once
Jarrow was on deck again. So while he slept, Locke
sat in the doorway of the cabin and read while Marjorie
played solitaire under a corner of the awning and
kept a watch toward shore.</p>

<p>Jarrow appeared late in the afternoon, and was
rather morose and silent. He went out on the forecastle
and smoked, scanning the sea and sky and
complaining to himself that there was no wind. The
sea was as smooth as a field of liquid metal, great
glassy swells extending to the horizon all round, glinting
in the sun. The heat was oppressive until the
sun dropped to the sea's rim, when dark wind patches
made their appearance to the southward on the surface
of the ocean. But still the calm held.</p>

<p>While the sky and sea were yet suffused with crimson
from the sun's afterglow Jarrow came aft, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
without a word to any one, or even a look, went on the
poop, going up the port side.</p>

<p>Marjorie went in and peeped into Dinshaw's room.
The old man was sleeping, breathing gently, but lying
like a man utterly exhausted, flat on his back in his
bunk.</p>

<p>As she came out on deck, where Trask and Locke
sat watching the sea and reconciling themselves to another
night aboard the schooner in the bight of the
reef, Jarrow's voice came over the cabin trunk in a
low growl as he cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"We better talk this thing over," he suggested.</p>

<p>"All right, captain," said Locke. "Suppose you
come down here."</p>

<p>Jarrow appeared at the starboard break of the poop,
his hands on his hips, a cigar aslant in his mouth. He
gave the trio a critical glance, and turned his head toward
the island.</p>

<p>"Not much chance to get out to-night," began
Locke. "Do you look for a breeze?"</p>

<p>"I don't look for nothin'," said the captain, without
looking at Locke. "I been thinkin' this thing over,"
he said presently, chewing his words with his cigar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
"I'm out of pocket on this deal."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" asked Locke, with a startled
glance at Trask. He had detected a belligerent note
in the captain's voice.</p>

<p>"Just this," said Jarrow, with sudden vehemence,
slapping his hand down on the cabin roof, and turning
a savage visage at the three sitting below him: "I
come on this trip lookin' to make a piece o' money. I
figured there'd be a couple of weeks here at the least&mdash;you'd
go lookin' for gold, an' maybe find it, an' I'd git
a look-in. Now ye want to skip out for Manila again.
Where do I git off?"</p>

<p>Trask sprang to his feet, his face scarlet with rage.</p>

<p>"You sit down, young feller," said Jarrow, holding up
a hand for attention. "Don't go off half-cocked."</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this?" demanded Locke.
His back was to Jarrow, and he did not get up.</p>

<p>Trask stood glaring at Jarrow with trembling lips
and set jaw. The captain pushed his cap back on his
head and puffed a couple of times at his cigar before he
spoke.</p>

<p>"I mean you can't git out of here, wind or no wind,
without me. And what's more, ye won't go when I do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
but ye'll pay me for my time, and I'll make it fair
enough."</p>

<p>"You're in with Peth!" exclaimed Trask, and made
a move toward his pistol pocket.</p>

<p>"I'm in with Peth," admitted Jarrow. "He didn't
work it just the way I wanted, but now it's come to a
show down. This schooner is for sale for twenty
thousand dollars. I guess that's fair enough, seein'
the jam ye're in, and the young lady along."</p>

<p>"I've half a mind to take a shot at you," said Trask.</p>

<p>"Go ahead and shoot," said Jarrow. "That's my
chance. I'll risk it. But you've got to handle the
rest of the crew before mornin', don't forgit that."</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand dollars," said Locke, musingly,
and looked at Marjorie, who stared at Jarrow as if she
could not believe her ears.</p>

<p>"My price," said Jarrow. "I thought I'd say
somethin' about it before the boys come out. They'll be
makin' along out this way in a few minutes. It'll save
messin' things up to reach a bargain before they come."</p>

<p>"The first man that tries to come aboard&mdash;&mdash;"
began Trask.</p>

<p>"You can't kill 'em all," said Jarrow, grinning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
"Oh, it's cheap at the price. You'll find it a lot more
comfortable to see this thing the way it lays. You
shoot me, and it's all off with ye. The boys'll just
have to boat off down the coast and say ye was lost
with the schooner. That's easy enough."</p>

<p>"You're a murderin' scoundrel," said Locke,
quietly.</p>

<p>"I'm out for the coin," said Jarrow. "Work with
me, and it'll be all right."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Trask," said Locke. "We might as
well go about this in a business way."</p>

<p>"Now ye're talkin'," said Jarrow.</p>

<p>"What's your proposition?" asked Locke. "Tom!
Bring me my cigar-case."</p>

<p>"I'm sellin' the schooner for twenty thousand. I
left word in Manila at your bank that you had a mind
to buy, an' you'd pay ten thousand. That's a fair
price. My bank thinks ye're goin to buy, too, so that's
another ten. I won't have no trouble cashin' two
checks on you. I cashed your checks in both banks
before we left, and they're sort o' trained to it."</p>

<p>"You're playing a dangerous game," said Locke.
"Do I understand you're to put us down in Manila<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and then go up to the banks and cash checks on me?"</p>

<p>"No," said Jarrow. "You stay here on the island,
hid away. If I don't git the money, it's you who's
playin' a dangerous game."</p>

<p>"But how are we to get away from here?" asked
Locke.</p>

<p>"We'll send the schooner back, after we've had
time to git clear of Manila. May be five or six days
after we git our money, but I'll send it right enough.
Of course, I could ask more, an' take a wide chance,
but I ain't hoggin' things. It ought to be worth gittin'
out without trouble for you folks. And ye'll git some
of yer money back out o' this old wagon. Say the
word, an' I'll signal the boys to come back, all peaceful,
an' no shootin'. If ye don't want to take it my way,
I'm done talkin'. The others look for fight, an' Peth's
got my gun's well's his own. So, if you want fireworks,
it ain't my funeral."</p>

<p>"I'll take you up," said Locke, as he reached for his
cigar-case. "You'll let us have Tom&mdash;and what we
need?"</p>

<p>"Everything ye want," said Jarrow, with satisfaction.
"Only don't come no didoes with me or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
checks. If I ain't here to tell Peth it's all right when
he comes alongside, he'll cut loose on ye in the dark."</p>

<p>"I'm giving you my word that we'll play fair, as you
call it. You'll get your checks, and all I ask is fair
play in return."</p>

<p>"My way o' lookin' at it," said Jarrow. "I thought
you'd find it a open an' shut game, an' I spoke as I did
so's you'd have time to pack an' stow the boats, if ye
don't want to stay aboard to-night. But there ain't
no call for you leavin' here 'less we git a wind."</p>

<p>"We'll take that up later," said Locke.</p>

<p>"I'd like a letter from you, as how ye've bought the
schooner," said Jarrow. "Ye can say's ye've decided
to remain here, and I'm to attend to some things in
Manila, so's it'll look natural like."</p>

<p>"As you say," said Locke. "If you'll fetch my
coat, I'll write out a check&mdash;the checks. And my
pen's with the book."</p>

<p>"I'll bring some paper," said Jarrow, with a glance
at Trask. "If you don't mind, unload your gun, and
give me the ca'tridges. I'll turn 'em over to ye when
ye leave for the island. How's that?"</p>

<p>"I'll compromise," said Trask. "Suppose Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Locke keeps the gun? You'd hardly expect Miss
Locke to shoot you in the back, would you?"</p>

<p>"I'll take the ca'tridges," said Jarrow, coming down
and holding out his hand. "I ain't figurin' on anybody
changin' their mind, but it'll be better to make
sure."</p>

<p>"Give him what he wants," said Locke. "We'll
play the game as the cards run."</p>

<p>So Trask took out the magazine, and removed the
cartridge from the chamber of the pistol and surrendered
the ammunition.</p>

<p>Jarrow went into his room for the paper, and they
heard him fumbling in the little bulkhead desk.</p>

<p>"No use arguing with a man when he's got the drop
on you," said Locke. "If it wasn't for Miss Trinkets,
here, it might be different. But I'd rather pay up
than see anybody hurt."</p>

<p>Trask sat with his empty pistol across his knees,
thoroughly dejected, staring out over the blood-red
sea. Already a star, close to the horizon, had
popped out, and the top of the island was gathering
gloom.</p>

<p>"I was a fool ever to take you people on such a wild-goose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
chase," said Trask. "I'll have to pay you back
every dollar of this, Mr. Locke."</p>

<p>"Pay nothing," said Locke.</p>

<p>"I'm the one to blame, Dad," said Marjorie, laying
her hand on his arm. She was quite white, but she
smiled faintly. "And you can't blame yourself, Mr.
Trask. It was all my plan from the first, Dad. We
plotted to inveigle you into coming to the island, at
least I abetted Mr. Trask, and I'm glad I came."</p>

<p>"I'm satisfied&mdash;&mdash;" said Locke, with a whimsical
smile, and before he could go on he was interrupted by
a scream of rage inside the cabin.</p>

<p>They all sprang up as Tom dashed from the galley
and looked into the captain's cabin. They saw the
white form of the Chinese against the dark interior,
and heard a terrific struggle going on, with the sound of
shoes being hammered against the bulkhead.</p>

<p>As the three pressed in to look over Tom's shoulder
Dinshaw leaped from the deck of the captain's cabin,
and yelling like mad, ran up the companion and dived
over the taffrail.</p>

<p>Trask ran after him in time to hear him splash into
the water, and turning to come through the cabin for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the long boat, heard Jarrow sobbing on the deck, and
crawling about, or so it seemed, for the captain's arms
were moving like a swimmer's although he was making
no progress forward. And as he struggled, he gave
gasping cries.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" cried Locke.</p>

<p>"He killum cap'n," said Shanghai Tom, and stooping
down, picked up a knife. It was a long knife from
the galley rack.</p>

<p>Marjorie ran from the cabin, overcome with horror,
and Trask followed, with the intention of getting the
long boat away to save Dinshaw. But as he paused,
poised on the bulwark to jump down into the boat, he
looked aft. There was no trace of Dinshaw.</p>

<p>"Go to the taffrail and look," he called to Marjorie.
She hastened to the poop-deck while he got the boat
off, which swung with the tide, and drifted aft as he
paddled with the big oar, standing in the stern.</p>

<p>For an instant there was a white object visible
against the dark water, as if a fish had broken the
surface. Whatever it was, it was being swept away
swiftly by the tide. Before Trask could reach the spot
where it had appeared, the water was smoothed out in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
a steely sheen. Dinshaw had been whirled away to
the coral depths below.</p>

<p>It was growing dark as Trask rowed back. As he
came alongside the schooner he saw Locke standing
beside Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Dead," said Locke.</p>

<p>From shore there came a confused chorus of cries.
Trask listened, and across the darkening waters he saw
a white spot drifting out slowly, and then in the evening
hush heard the clatter of oars.</p>

<p>"The cartridges!" he cried. "They're coming out,
Peth and the others. With Jarrow dead, we've a
fight on our hands!"</p>

<p>He leaped over the bulwark, and dashed into
Jarrow's cabin, to regain the ammunition he had
surrendered. A blazing match revealed Jarrow lying
on his back, his face distorted and spotted. Trask
found the cartridges loose in the captain's coat pocket,
and hurried out of the cabin.</p>



<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">An End and a Beginning</span></h2>


<p>A red moon rose out of the sea, and threw
a fiery trail over the heaving wastes that
reached to the schooner's side. Her hull
and masts stood out in bold relief like a vessel in
silhouette before the glare of a volcano.</p>

<p>Trask, Locke, and Shanghai Tom stood on the starboard
side abreast of the foremast where they could
see over the bows and still be in a position to resist
from either side when the crew attempted to board.
Locke had a pair of iron belaying pins, and while Tom
had a similar weapon, he also had a galley knife.
Marjorie stood just outside the cabin door, where
she could retreat inside and protect herself against
bullets.</p>

<p>The boat came forward slowly and cautiously, now
only a dark spot on the water, still covered by the
gloom of the island. The crew apparently hoped to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
get close without alarming those aboard.</p>

<p>"We'll let them come on, and then give it to them
without warning," said Trask. "I'll hold my fire
until they're right under us. Keep low, so they can't
see our heads."</p>

<p>Watching over the bulwark, Trask saw the boat
come out of the island's shadow into the moonlight.
He expected a dash once the boat was exposed, for it
would be useless to attempt to sneak up on the
schooner if any watch were kept.</p>

<p>But the rowers came on leisurely. It might be that
they supposed Jarrow would be the only one on watch
and would allow them to get alongside before their
proximity was suspected by Trask and Locke.</p>

<p>"I can't see but three," whispered Locke.</p>

<p>"Others may be hidden," said Trask. "Or they've
decided to cut their party in two, to intercept anybody
who got away to the island."</p>

<p>"We can handle three, all right," said Locke, with
some relief. "They'll walk right into a trap."</p>

<p>"They probably figured Jarrow would have things
fixed for them by the time they arrived, by having
some of us out of the way. It isn't possible that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
could know what's happened to him," remarked Trask.</p>

<p>The boat came on slowly and silently, the oars working
steadily but with little noise of locks. It headed
for the starboard side, and came up within a dozen
yards of the bow abreast of it. Then the oars were
held, backing slowly.</p>

<p>"Aboard there!" came a low, hoarse voice. Trask
and his friends remained silent.</p>

<p>There was an exchange of whispers. Then the oars
backed water quietly, to check the way and overcome
the tide.</p>

<p>"Aboard there!" This time it was louder, and
Trask knew it was not the voice of Peth.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he answered, gruffly, speaking as he
thought Jarrow might if he were waiting for his
treacherous crew to seize the schooner.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" asked the voice. It was more
cautious, and apparently worried. After a pause:
"Is it Mr. Trask?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Trask boldly. There was something
hopeful in the tone of the other. If it had been Peth,
Trask would not have admitted his own identity.</p>

<p>"Then it's all right," said the other. "I'm Bevins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Where's the skipper?"</p>

<p>"In his room asleep," answered Trask, still cautious,
and not to be fooled into telling the truth. If they
expected Jarrow, it would puzzle them to be told the
captain was not there to meet them.</p>

<p>"Look out for him," said Bevins, hastily. "He's
fixin' to do for ye. We've run away from Mr. Peth.
Shope and Pennock are here with me. We don't
want no trouble. We want to come back aboard for
duty. But have an eye out for the skipper. He's
lookin' for Mr. Peth to come out, but we got the
dinghy."</p>

<p>"We stood in with him for gold," said another voice,
pleadingly. "But when it come to makin' trouble for
you folks, we ain't for it."</p>

<p>"Come up closer so I can look into the boat,"
commanded Trask.</p>

<p>"You better lock the skipper in his room," said
Bevins. "We don't want to come aboard if he's going
to make a row. He's a slick one, and he thought
we stood in with him&mdash;thought we'd come out with
Mr. Peth to put you ashore, but we give 'em the dish&mdash;Mr.
Peth and the nigger. You better git the skipper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
or he'll be down on ye."</p>

<p>They pulled the boat in, and under Trask's orders
walked about the bottom, to prove that there was no
one lying hidden under their feet.</p>

<p>"You may come aboard, Bevins," said Trask
finally. "But the others stay where they are a
few minutes. If they attempt to rush, they'll get
shot."</p>

<p>"Git the skipper before I come," begged Bevins.
"Git him while he's asleep. Don't take no
chances. He's up to maroon ye all."</p>

<p>"We've got the skipper," said Trask, grimly.
"Don't worry about him. He is dead."</p>

<p>There were exclamations of surprise and joy from
the boat.</p>

<p>"Ye done for him? No foolin'?" asked Bevins.</p>

<p>"No doubt about it. Come aboard and see for
yourself."</p>

<p>"Ye won't make no trouble for us for what we done
if we come for duty?"</p>

<p>"Not if you help us get back to Manila, and make
no more trouble."</p>

<p>"We don't want no trouble, honest to Gawd!" said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Shope.</p>

<p>"Mr. Peth he got us to go ashore just for fun," said
Bevins. "I know we had no call for doin' of it but he
said we'd be back in the mornin'. Said the skipper
give orders for it."</p>

<p>"We'll call it square if you men turn to," said Trask.
"But if there's any more trouble the first man to start
it, follows Jarrow. You'll have to understand that
before you come aboard. We're all armed and you'll
have to be searched."</p>

<p>"That's fair," said Bevins. "I'll come first. I
ain't got no arms."</p>

<p>They worked the boat aft to where the pilot-ladder
was and Bevins came up. Trask searched him from
head to toe while Locke and Tom kept watch on the
others in the dinghy.</p>

<p>Trask believed that Bevins was telling the truth.
His warning about the captain and his reluctance to
come aboard until he was assured that Jarrow could
do no harm were convincing. If the three in the boat
had been in league with Jarrow, it was improbable that
they would tell Trask that the captain was a menace.</p>

<p>Bevins then asked to see Jarrow. So Trask sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
him aft and gave him matches to examine the captain's
room. He came back presently, and with considerable
satisfaction assured his companions that they need
have no further fear of the skipper.</p>

<p>Marjorie came forward to her father, and finding
that instead of a battle they were safer than ever, she
began to cry softly.</p>

<p>Bevins now advised that it was necessary to keep a
sharp lookout toward shore. He was afraid that Peth
and Doc would make some attempt to get out to the
schooner.</p>

<p>Shanghai Tom went to the galley and prepared a
meal for the three who had returned. After shutting
the door of Jarrow's room the cabin lamp was lighted,
as if in defiance of the two ashore and to prove that all
was well aboard the schooner.</p>

<p>Shope was given coffee and a cigar and put on watch,
while all hands joined in a meal in the cabin. Bevins
went over the whole story of how Mr. Peth had held
up the captain ashore, but that it was all to mislead
those in the schooner, and how after taking to the
brush the captain had told them his plans for "making
a nice pot of money" out of the expedition, they having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
found no gold.</p>

<p>Doc had been in with Jarrow and Peth from the first.
He had been told to play the spy, but he had kept
secret his theft of the pistol from Trask's bag, a circumstance
which puzzled Jarrow. The captain taxed
Peth with having made a blunder so early in the game,
and it was not until Doc had declared himself as the
dinghy approached the schooner with Jarrow and his
men that the secret of who had the pistol came out.</p>

<p>Doc had been told to return with the long boat
after Jarrow was held up by Peth, and announce the
captain's capture. When the captain came out again
it was with the intention of getting aboard the schooner
and putting Trask, Locke, and Marjorie ashore.</p>

<p>Jarrow had planned that the party which went
ashore in the night would get back in the morning
before they were discovered, but when Trask learned
of the secret departure, Jarrow had signalled them to
remain ashore, by means of the lantern in the forerigging.</p>

<p>If the crew had got back aboard the schooner without
having aroused any suspicions, it was Jarrow's
intention to get his three passengers on the island, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
then demand checks, leaving them there while he
took the schooner back to Manila and got the money.</p>

<p>Bevins, Shope, and Pennock had no idea of what had
been planned until Jarrow told the whole plot ashore.
Then it came out that Peth's refusal to sleep aft was
arranged by Jarrow and Peth to make it appear that
they were at odds. The demand for money was
to be made ostensibly by Peth, Jarrow always pretending
that he was in the power of the crew.</p>

<p>Doc's report of how Trask had "cooked" gold out
of the sand had set them all to burning sand, but when
they found no gold after cooling the sand, Peth and
Doc had quarrelled, the mate calling the steward
names and charging him with being as crazy as Dinshaw.
Peth doubted Doc's story of Trask finding gold
at all. Doc had been chased by Peth, and in escaping
from the mate's fury, the steward, being barefoot, had
burned his feet so badly that he couldn't walk, having
run into some of the red-hot sand.</p>

<p>So Doc was to have been left behind in the night
attack on the schooner, and it was due to his disability
that the trio was able to steal the dinghy. Bevins
said that Doc had once killed a man, and Jarrow knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
about it, with the result that the captain held the
Negro under his control.</p>

<p>During the night they heard Peth halloing to the
schooner, calling for Jarrow, but they gave no answer.
Peth continued to call, like a dog baying the great
moon which wheeled overhead, until along toward
dawn, when the fire on the beach flared up for a while
and then died.</p>

<p>Before daylight there was a nervous stir of air, and
the sun rose on a cloud from the north. The breeze
freshened, and Bevins, now in command, got the
anchor, and under jib and reefed foresail they headed
out for the sea.</p>

<p>Jarrow's room having been cleared early in the
night, and the captain wrapped in old canvas, the
body was dropped overboard as they passed clear of
the reefs, Trask saying from memory as much as he
could remember of the service for burials at sea.</p>

<p>Through the glass Trask saw a white figure watching
them from the edge of the jungle as they drove
southward for Manila before a steady wind from the
northeast.</p>

<p>Marjorie, who had slept after midnight, leaned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
against the taffrail with Trask, watching Shope and
Pennock trimming the sails. Bevins had the wheel
but Locke was asleep below, having remained up all
night.</p>

<p>"Poor old Captain Dinshaw," said Marjorie.
"He'll never have his big house with good soup for
supper."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's just as well," replied Trask. "He
was too old and pitifully crazy ever to enjoy anything.
It's likely he would have suffered more if he'd never
come to his island. And he might have killed somebody
not so deserving of the fate he meted out to
Jarrow."</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll come back and really look for gold
when we're gone," she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her.</p>

<p>"No more of that island for me," he said. "The
government will most likely send a boat to get Mr.
Peth and Doc but I wouldn't come back here if the
island were all gold."</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked, somewhat surprised.</p>

<p>"Because it meant great peril for you. I would not
care to have those terrible dangers recalled. I want to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
think of you as safe and happy. But there's one
thing about it all which gives me satisfaction."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"You'll never forget me!"</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Trask, of course I won't! What a silly
thing to say!"</p>

<p>"You might if it hadn't been for what we've been
through in this schooner." He looked out over the
sea.</p>

<p>"I hardly think so," she said, smiling at him. "Of
course, you didn't understand what a joke Dad was
going to play on Jarrow about the checks."</p>

<p>"What joke!" demanded Trask, turning to her.</p>

<p>"Dad's balance at the International in Manila is
only about four thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Then it might have been anything but a joke if
Jarrow had come on for the money and didn't get it,"
said Trask. "But I suppose the bank would have
allowed an overdraft."</p>

<p>"There couldn't be any overdraft. That four
thousand is all the cash we've got in the world. Dad's
supposed to be rich, but he isn't. We have only a
little fruit ranch in Southern California. We've been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
saving up for ten years for this trip around the world,
since mother died. Jarrow would have found himself
in trouble if he had attempted to cash those checks."</p>

<p>"I thought your father was a millionaire?"</p>

<p>"There is a man named Locke who has millions in
California, but he is not a relative of ours."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it!" cried Trask. "By George, I'm
glad to hear it!"</p>

<p>"Glad that we're not rich! Why, Mr. Trask!"</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm going back to the States," he announced.
"On the same boat you do, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"You've changed your plans?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm going to quit mine-scouting out in these
God-forsaken ends of the earth, and get back to where
there's civilization. I think I'll buy a fruit ranch in
Southern California. I've got enough capital. And
what mining I do, I'll do it in California."</p>

<p>She scanned his face, amazed at what he was saying,
and startled at his seriousness.</p>

<p>"Come below, and I'll tell you about<!--**changed abou to about--> it," he said, and
she went down before him.</p>

<p>"Marjorie," he said, seeing that Shanghai Tom was
out of sight in the galley, and her father's door was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
closed, "I've been in love with you since that first
night in the <i>Manchuria</i>. But I thought&mdash;well, I
thought you had millions!"</p>

<p>"Wilkins told everybody we were rich." She put
her hand on his arm so gently that he could scarcely
feel its weight. "I&mdash;love you. I was sure of it when
Doc aimed that revolver at you."</p>

<p>He swept her into his arms.</p>

<p>"Thank God you missed the Hong Kong boat," he
said.</p>

<p>"I really wanted to see you again," she confessed.</p>

<p>"But you were going home."</p>

<p>"It was I who made Dad miss the <i>Taming</i>. Anyway,
I didn't tell him we'd have to get the morning
train from Dagupan."</p>

<p>"For that I'm going to kiss you again," said
Trask. And he did.</p>

<p>Immediately on the arrival of the <i>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora
del Rosario</i> at Manila the coastguard cutter <i>Candelaria</i>
sailed for Dinshaw's island. Peth and Doc Bird, seeing
the steamer approaching, attempted to leave the
island on an uncompleted raft, which broke up with
them, and both were drowned, Doc clinging to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
mate when they were thrown into the water.</p>

<p>The next Hong Kong boat left Manila with Mr.
Locke and Mr. and Mrs. Robert Trask among the
passengers.</p>

<p>Shanghai Tom opened a Chinese restaurant in
Manila with the capital provided by Locke and Trask
as a reward for his bravery in disarming the steward.</p>

<p>Trask declares that his days of hunting gold are
over. Locke says that there is no longer a lure for
him in tropical islands, and Mrs. Trask vows that all
the romance there is between Cancer and Capricorn
can be claimed by any one who wants it, for she is
happy enough on the west coast of the United States
of America, with the picture of Dinshaw's island hanging
in the Trask bungalow.</p>
